```
getInterpolationWeights(tsg, x)
```

returns the interpolation weights associated with the points in getPoints()

x: a vector with length dimensions    the entries indicate the points for evaluating the weights

output: a vector of length getNumPoints()         the order of the weights matches the order in getPoints()
