A unified interface for log density problems, for

1. defining mappings to a log density (eg Bayesian for inference),
2. optionally obtaining a gradient using automatic differentiation,
3. defining a common interface for working with such log densities and gradients (eg MCMC).

These use cases utilize different parts of this package, make sure you read the documentation.
