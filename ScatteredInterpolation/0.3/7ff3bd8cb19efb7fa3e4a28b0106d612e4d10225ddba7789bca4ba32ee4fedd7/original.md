GeneralizedPolyharmonic(k, degree)
```

Define a generalized Polyharmonic Radial Basis Function

$$
ϕ(r) = r^k, k = 1, 3, 5, ...
\\
ϕ(r) = r^k ln(r), k = 2, 4, 6, ...
$$

Results in a positive definite system for a 'degree' of ⌈k/2⌉ or higher for k = 1, 3, 5, ... and of exactly k + 1 for k = 2, 4, 6, ...
