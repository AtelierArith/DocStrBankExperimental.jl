VoronoiPolygon
```

Abstract supertype for Voronoi Polygons. We call them Voronoi Polygons and not Voronoi cells to avoid confusion with cells of a cell list. No functions need to be defined for subtypes of Voronoi Polygon but we require that it has these fields

  * `x::RealVector`
  * `edges::FastVector{Edge}`

where `x` is the generating seed and edges is a list of all edges in no particular order. The `edges` can be  initialized as `edges = emptypolygon()` and are generated by the `remesh!` function.  The subtypes may contain additional fields depending on the physics involved. See `src/celldefs.jl` for examples.
