Create a `PeriodicDerivativeOperator` approximating the `derivative_order`-th derivative on a uniform grid between `xmin` and `xmax` with `N` grid points up to order of accuracy `accuracy_order` where `stencil_width` determines the number of nodes used for the finite difference stencil. The evaluation of the derivative can be parallelized using threads by choosing `mode = ThreadedMode()`.
