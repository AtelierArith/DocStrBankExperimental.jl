Create a [`PeriodicDerivativeOperator`](@ref) approximating the `derivative_order`-th derivative on a uniform grid between `xmin` and `xmax` with `N` grid points up to order of accuracy `accuracy_order` where the leftmost grid point used is determined by `left_offset`. The evaluation of the derivative can be parallelized using threads by choosing `mode=ThreadedMode())`.
