```
iscomplement(H1::HalfSpace, H2::HalfSpace)
```

Check if two half-spaces complement each other.

### Input

  * `H1` – half-space
  * `H2` – half-space

### Output

`true` iff `H1` and `H2` are complementary, i.e., have opposite normal directions and identical boundaries (defining hyperplanes).
