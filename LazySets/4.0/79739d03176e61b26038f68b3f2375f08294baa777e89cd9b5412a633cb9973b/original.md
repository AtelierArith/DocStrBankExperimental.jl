```

Evaluate the support function of the intersection of a compact set and a half-space/hyperplane/line in a given direction.

### Input

  * `d`         – direction
  * `cap`       – lazy intersection of a compact set and a half-space/hyperplane/                line
  * `algorithm` – (optional, default: `"line_search"`): the algorithm to                calculate the support function; valid options are:

      * `"line_search"` – solve the associated univariate optimization problem                    using a line-search method (either Brent or the                    Golden Section method)
      * `"projection"`  – only valid for intersection with a hyperplane/line;                    evaluate the support function by reducing the problem                    to the 2D intersection of a rank-2 linear                    transformation of the given compact set in the plane                    generated by the given direction `d` and the                    hyperplane's normal vector `n`
      * `"simple"`      – take the $\min$ of the support-function evaluation                    of each operand

### Output

The scalar value of the support function of the set `cap` in the given direction.

### Notes

It is assumed that the first set of the intersection (`cap.X`) is compact.

Any additional number of arguments to the algorithm backend can be passed as keyword arguments.

### Algorithm

The algorithms are based on solving the associated optimization problem

$$
\min_{λ ∈ D_h} ρ(ℓ - λa, X) + λb.
$$

where $D_h = \{ λ : λ ≥ 0 \}$ if $H$ is a half-space or $D_h = \{ λ : λ ∈ ℝ \}$ if $H$ is a hyperplane.
