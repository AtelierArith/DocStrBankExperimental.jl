```
constraints_list(cap::Intersection)
```

Return a list of constraints of an intersection of two (polyhedral) sets.

### Input

  * `cap` â€“ intersection of two (polyhedral) sets

### Output

A list of constraints of the intersection.

### Notes

We assume that the underlying sets are polyhedral, i.e., offer a method `constraints_list`.

### Algorithm

We create the polyhedron by taking the intersection of the `constraints_list`s of the sets and remove redundant constraints.

This function ignores the boolean output from the in-place `remove_redundant_constraints!`, which may inform the user that the constraints are infeasible. In that case, the list of constraints at the moment when the infeasibility was detected is returned.
