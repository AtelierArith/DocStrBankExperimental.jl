```
constraints_list(lm::LinearMap)
```

Return the list of constraints of a (polyhedral) linear map.

### Input

  * `lm` â€“ linear map

### Output

The list of constraints of the linear map.

### Notes

We assume that the underlying set `X` is polyhedral, i.e., offers a method `constraints_list(X)`.

### Algorithm

We fall back to a concrete set representation by applying `linear_map`.
