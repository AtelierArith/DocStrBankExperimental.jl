```
σ(d::AbstractVector, ms::MinkowskiSum)
```

Return a support vector of a Minkowski sum of two sets.

### Input

  * `d`  – direction
  * `ms` – Minkowski sum of two sets

### Output

A support vector in the given direction. If the direction has norm zero, the result depends on the summand sets.

### Algorithm

A valid support vector in direction $d$ of the Minkowski sum of two sets $X$ and $Y$ is the sum of the support vectors of $X$ and $Y$ in direction $d$.
