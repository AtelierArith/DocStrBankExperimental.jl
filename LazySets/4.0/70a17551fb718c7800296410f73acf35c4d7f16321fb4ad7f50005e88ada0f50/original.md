```
isempty(cms::CachedMinkowskiSumArray)
```

Check whether a cached Minkowski sum array is empty.

### Input

  * `cms` â€“ cached Minkowski sum

### Output

`true` iff any of the wrapped sets are empty.

### Notes

Forgotten sets cannot be checked anymore. Normally they should not have been empty because otherwise the support-vector query would have crashed before. In that case, the cached Minkowski sum should not be used further.
