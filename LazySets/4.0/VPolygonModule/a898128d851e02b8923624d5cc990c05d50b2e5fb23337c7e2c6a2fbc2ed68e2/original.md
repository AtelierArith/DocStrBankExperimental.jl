```
remove_redundant_vertices(P::VPolygon;
                          [algorithm]::String="monotone_chain")
```

Return a polygon obtained by removing the redundant vertices of the given polygon.

### Input

  * `P`         – polygon in vertex representation
  * `algorithm` – (optional, default: "monotone_chain") the algorithm used to                compute the convex hull

### Output

A new polygon such that its vertices are the convex hull of the given polygon.

### Algorithm
