```
ρ(d::AbstractVector, ms::MinkowskiSum)
```

Evaluate the support function of a Minkowski sum of two sets.

### Input

  * `d`  – direction
  * `ms` – Minkowski sum of two sets

### Output

The evaluation of the support function in the given direction.

### Algorithm

The support function in direction $d$ of the Minkowski sum of two sets $X$ and $Y$ is the sum of the support functions of $X$ and $Y$ in direction $d$.
