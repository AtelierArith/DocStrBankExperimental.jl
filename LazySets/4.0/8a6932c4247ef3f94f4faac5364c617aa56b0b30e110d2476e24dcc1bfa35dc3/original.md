```
vertices_list(cap::Intersection)
```

Return a list of vertices of a lazy intersection of two (polyhedral) sets.

### Input

  * `cap` â€“ intersection of two (polyhedral) sets

### Output

A list containing the vertices of the lazy intersection of two sets.

### Notes

We assume that the underlying sets are polyhedral and that the intersection is bounded.

### Algorithm

We compute the concrete intersection using `intersection` and then take the vertices of that representation.
