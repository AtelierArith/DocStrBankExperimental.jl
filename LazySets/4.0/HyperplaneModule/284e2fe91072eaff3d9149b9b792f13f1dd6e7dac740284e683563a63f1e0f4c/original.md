```
constrained_dimensions(H::Hyperplane)
```

Return the dimensions in which a hyperplane is constrained.

### Input

  * `H` – hyperplane

### Output

A vector of ascending indices `i` such that the hyperplane is constrained in dimension `i`.

### Examples

A 2D hyperplane with constraint $x_1 = 0$ is constrained in dimension 1 only.
