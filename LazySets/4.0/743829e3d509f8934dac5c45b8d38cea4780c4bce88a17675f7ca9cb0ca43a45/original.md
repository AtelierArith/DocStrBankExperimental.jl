```
vertices_list(cp::CartesianProduct)
```

Return the list of vertices of a (polytopic) Cartesian product.

### Input

  * `cp` â€“ polytopic Cartesian product

### Output

A list of vertices.

### Algorithm

We assume that the underlying sets are polytopic. Then the high-dimensional set of vertices is just the Cartesian product of the low-dimensional sets of vertices.
