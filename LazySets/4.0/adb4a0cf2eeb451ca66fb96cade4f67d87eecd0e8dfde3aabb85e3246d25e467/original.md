```
σ(d::AbstractVector, cap::Intersection)
```

Return a support vector of an intersection of two sets in a given direction.

### Input

  * `d`   – direction
  * `cap` – intersection of two sets

### Output

A support vector in the given direction.

### Algorithm

We compute the concrete intersection, which may be expensive.
