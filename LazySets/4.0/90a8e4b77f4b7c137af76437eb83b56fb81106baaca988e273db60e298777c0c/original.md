ρ(d::AbstractVector, msa::MinkowskiSumArray)

Evaluate the support function of a Minkowski sum of a finite number of sets in a given direction.

### Input

  * `d`   – direction
  * `msa` – Minkowski sum of a finite number of sets

### Output

The evaluation of the support function in the given direction.

### Algorithm

The support function of the Minkowski sum of multiple sets evaluations to the sum of the support-function evaluations of each set.
