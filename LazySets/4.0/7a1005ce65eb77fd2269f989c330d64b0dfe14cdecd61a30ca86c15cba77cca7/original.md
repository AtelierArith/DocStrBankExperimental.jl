```
ρ(d::AbstractVector, cha::ConvexHullArray)
```

Evaluate the support function of a convex hull of a finite number of sets in a given direction.

### Input

  * `d`   – direction
  * `cha` – convex hull of a finite number of sets

### Output

The evaluation of the support function of the convex hull of a finite number of sets in the given direction.

### Algorithm

This algorithm calculates the maximum over all $ρ(d, X_i)$, where the $X_1, …, X_k$ are the sets in the array of `cha`.
