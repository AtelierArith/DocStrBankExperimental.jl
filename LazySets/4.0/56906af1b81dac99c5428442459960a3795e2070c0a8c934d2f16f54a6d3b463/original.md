```
ρ(d::AbstractVector, rm::ResetMap)
```

Evaluate the support function of a reset map.

### Input

  * `d`  – direction
  * `rm` – reset map

### Output

The evaluation of the support function in the given direction.

### Notes

We use the usual dot-product definition, but for unbounded sets we redefine the product between $0$ and $±∞$ as $0$; Julia returns `NaN` here.

```jldoctest
julia> Inf * 0.0
NaN
```
