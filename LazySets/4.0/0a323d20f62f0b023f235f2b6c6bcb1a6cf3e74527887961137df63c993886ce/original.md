```
σ(d::AbstractVector, ia::IntersectionArray)
```

Return a support vector of an intersection of a finite number of sets in a given direction.

### Input

  * `d`  – direction
  * `ia` – intersection of a finite number of sets

### Output

A support vector in the given direction. If the direction has norm zero, the result depends on the individual sets.

### Algorithm

This implementation computes the concrete intersection, which can be expensive.
