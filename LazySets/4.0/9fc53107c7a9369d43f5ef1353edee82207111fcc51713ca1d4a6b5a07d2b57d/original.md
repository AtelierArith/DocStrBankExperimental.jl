```
linear_map(M::AbstractMatrix, ilm::InverseLinearMap)
```

Return the linear map of a lazy inverse linear map.

### Input

  * `M`   – matrix
  * `ilm` – inverse linear map

### Output

The set representing the linear map of the lazy inverse linear map of a set.

### Notes

This implementation is inefficient because it computes the concrete inverse of $M$, which is what `InverseLinearMap` is supposed to avoid.
