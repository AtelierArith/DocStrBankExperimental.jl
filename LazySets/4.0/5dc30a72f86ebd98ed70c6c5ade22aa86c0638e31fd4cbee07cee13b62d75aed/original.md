ρ(d::AbstractVector, cup::UnionSetArray)

Evaluate the support function of the union of a finite number of sets in a given direction.

### Input

  * `d`   – direction
  * `cup` – union of a finite number of sets

### Output

The evaluation of the support function in the given direction.

### Algorithm

The support function of the union of a finite number of sets $X₁, X₂, ...$ can be obtained as the maximum of $ρ(d, X₂), ρ(d, X₂), ...$.
