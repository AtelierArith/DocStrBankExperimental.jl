```
ρ(d::AbstractVector, cup::UnionSet)
```

Evaluate the support function of the union of two sets in a given direction.

### Input

  * `d`   – direction
  * `cup` – union of two sets

### Output

The evaluation of the support function in the given direction.

### Algorithm

The support function of the union of two sets $X$ and $Y$ evaluates to the maximum of the support-function evaluations of $X$ and $Y$.
