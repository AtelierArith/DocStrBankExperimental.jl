This data type is used to store a sparse matrix in the COO (or coordinate) format through the `irn`, `jcn` and `val` fields containing the row indices, column indices and values, respectively and the `m`, `n` and `nz` containing the number of rows, columns and nonzeros, respectively. qr_mumps uses a Fortran-style 1-based numbering and thus all row indices are expected to be between 1 and m and all the column indices between 1 and n. Duplicate entries are summed during the factorization, out-of-bound entries are ignored. The `sym` field is used to specify if the matrix is symmetric and positive definite (`true`) or not (`false`).
