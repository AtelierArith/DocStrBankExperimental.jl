This data type represents a "shifted" matrix. When one wants to solve a "regularized" problem of the form `(AᵀA + αI)x = b`, one can use a QR factorization of the block matrix `QR = (A  √α)ᵀ` and note that `RᵀR = AᵀA + αI`. This type of problem is especially useful when `A` is poorly conditioned or rank deficient. It only contains a `qrm_spmat` matrix representing the above block matrix and the regularization parameter `α`.
