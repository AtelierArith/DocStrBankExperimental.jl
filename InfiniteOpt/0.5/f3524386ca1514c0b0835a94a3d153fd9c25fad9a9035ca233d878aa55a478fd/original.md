```
raw_function(prefs; [kwargs...])
```

Define `raw_function` for general variable references. It relies on `raw_function` being defined for the underlying `DispatchVariableRef`, otherwise an `ArgumentError` is thrown. See the underlying docstrings for more information. Note that this is a auto generated wrapper and the underlying method may or may not use `kwargs`.
