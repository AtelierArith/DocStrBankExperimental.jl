GaussRadau <: FiniteGaussQuad
```

An integral evaulation method that uses Gauss-Radau quadrature to evaluate integrals. This is valid for finite integral domains. Note this will generate its own set of supports and will ignore other parameter supports. This is not compatible with individual dependent parameters. Contains no fields.
