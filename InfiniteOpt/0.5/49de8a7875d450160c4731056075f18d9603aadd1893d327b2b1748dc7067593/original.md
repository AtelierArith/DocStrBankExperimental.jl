Build expressions for derivative `dref` evaluated in accordance with `method`.  The expressions are of the form `lhs - rhs`, where `lhs` is a function of derivatives evaluated at some supports for certain infinite parameter, and `rhs` is a function of the derivative arguments evaluated at some supports for certain infinite parameter. For example, for finite difference methods at point `t = 1`, `lhs` is `Δt * ∂/∂t[T(1)]`, and `rhs` could be `T(1+Δt) - T(1)` in case of forward difference mode. This is intended as a helper function for `evaluate`, which  will take the the expressions generated by this method and generate constraints that approximate the derivative values by setting the expressions as 0. However, one can extend this function  to encode custom methods for approximating derivatives. This should invoke  `add_derivative_supports` if the method is generative and users will likely find  it convenient to use `make_reduced_expr`.
