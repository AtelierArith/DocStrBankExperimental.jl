```
supports(pref::IndependentParameterRef; 
         [label::Type{<:AbstractSupportLabel} = PublicLabel])::Vector{Float64}
```

Return the support points associated with `pref`. Errors if there are no supports. Users can query just support points generated by a certain method using the keyword argument `label`. By default, the function returns all public support points regardless of the associated label. The full collection is given by setting  `label = All`. Moreover, the amount of labels that satisfy `label` is obtained  using an [`AbstractSupportLabel`](@ref).

**Example**

```julia-repl
julia> supports(t)
2-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.0
 1.0
```
