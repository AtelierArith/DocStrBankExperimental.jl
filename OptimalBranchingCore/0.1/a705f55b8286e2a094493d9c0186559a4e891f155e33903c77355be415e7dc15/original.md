```
minimize_γ(table::BranchingTable, candidates::Vector{Clause}, Δρ::Vector, solver)
```

Finds the optimal cover based on the provided vector of problem size reduction. This function implements a cover selection algorithm using an iterative process. It utilizes an integer programming solver to optimize the selection of sub-covers based on their complexity.

### Arguments

  * `table::BranchingTable`: A branching table containing clauses that need to be covered, a table entry is covered by a clause if one of its bit strings satisfies the clause. Please refer to [`covered_by`](@ref) for more details.
  * `candidates::Vector{Clause}`: A vector of candidate clauses to form the branching rule (in the form of [`DNF`](@ref)).
  * `Δρ::Vector`: A vector of problem size reduction for each candidate clause.
  * `solver`: The solver to be used. It can be an instance of `LPSolver` or `IPSolver`.

### Returns

A tuple of two elements: (indices of selected subsets, γ)
