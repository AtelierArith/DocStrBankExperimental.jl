```
shapefile_coords_poly(poly::Shapefile.Polygon)
```

Return the polygons contained in shp.shapes[i]. It returns an array containing the polygons.

See also [`shapefile_coords`](@ref), which returns vectors as opposed to array. Returned polygon is consistent with the data extraction of the [`load`](@ref) function.
