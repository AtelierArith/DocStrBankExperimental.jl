```
coordoperators(sys)
coordoperators(basis)
coordoperators(lat[, internal])
```

Generate a `Tuple` of coordinate operators for the given lattice.

## Arguments

  * `sys`: a `System` for which the coordinate operators are to be generated.
  * `basis`: a one-particle `Basis` for which the coordinate operators are to be generated.
  * `lat`: a lattice for which the coordinate operators are to be generated.
  * `internal`: The basis for the internal degrees of freedom.
