"Construct a gate operation that applies a biased Pauli error on  qubit `q` with independent probabilities `px`, `py`, `pz`. Note that the probability of any error occurring is `px+py+pz`. Because of this, `PauliError(1, p)` is equivalent to `PauliError(1,p/3,p/3,p/3)`. Similarly, if one wanted to exclude Z errors from `PauliError(1,p/3,p/3,p/3)` while mainting the same rate of X errors, one could write `PauliError(1, p*2/3, 0, 0)` (in the sense that Y errors can be interpreted as an X and a Z happening at the same time).
