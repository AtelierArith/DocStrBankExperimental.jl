Generate a Pauli operator by using operators from a given the Stabilizer.

**It assumes the stabilizer is already canonicalized.** It modifies the Pauli operator in place, generating it in reverse, up to a phase. That phase is left in the modified operator, which should be the identity up to a phase. Returns the new operator and the list of indices denoting the elements of `stabilizer` that were used for the generation.

```jldoctest
julia> ghz = S"XXXX
               ZZII
               IZZI
               IIZZ";


julia> canonicalize!(ghz)
+ XXXX
+ Z__Z
+ _Z_Z
+ __ZZ

julia> generate!(P"-ZIZI", ghz)
(- ____, [2, 4])
```

When the Pauli operator can not be generated by the given tableau, `nothing` is returned.

```jldoctest
julia> generate!(P"XII",canonicalize!(S"ZII")) === nothing
true

julia> generate!(P"XII",canonicalize!(S"XII")) === nothing
false
```
