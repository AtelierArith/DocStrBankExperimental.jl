FreeEvol
```

Struct for a quantum physics operator that describes evolution of unperturbed quantum two-level system. This evolution can be described in the way of changing phase difference between `|e>` and `|g>` states.

# Fields

  * `operator`:   Represents operator itself in a form of a matrix.

# Arguments

  * `x` :   The `phase difference` between `|e>` and `|g>` states   as a result of free evolution.

# Returns

  * `FreeEvol` :   Composite type instance.
