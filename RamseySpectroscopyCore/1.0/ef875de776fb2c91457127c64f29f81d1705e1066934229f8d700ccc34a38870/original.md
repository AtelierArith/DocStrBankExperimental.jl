StateVector
```

Struct that describes a state of the quantum two-level system via ket vector in Dirac notation.

# Fields

  * `state` :   Vector that represents the state of the system in (|e>, |g>) basis.

# Arguments

  * `e` :   Numerical value that implies the probability of a quantum system to be in excited state   or the amount of particles in the ground state.   Value of |e> ket vector.
  * `g` :   Numerical value that implies the probability of a quantum system to be in ground state   or the amount of particles in the ground state.   Value of |g> ket vector.

# Returns

  * `StateVector` :   Composite type instance.
