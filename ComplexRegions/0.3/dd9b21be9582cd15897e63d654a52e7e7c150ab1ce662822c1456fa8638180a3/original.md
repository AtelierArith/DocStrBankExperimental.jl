```
isoutside(X,z)
```

Detect whether `z` lies outside the closed curve or path `X`. For a bounded path, this always means the unbounded region complementary to the enclosure of the curve, regardless of orientation; for an unbounded path, it means the region "to the right" as one walks along the path.
