ReferenceState(type::Symbol = :no_set;T0 = NaN;P0 = NaN,H0 = NaN,S0 = NaN,phase = :unknown,z0 = Float64[])
```

Parameter used to define a reference state for enthalpy and entropy, normally stored in the ideal model.  when set, it calculates a set of `a0` and `a1` values such as the entropy and enthalpy at a specified point are fixed.

the `type` argument accepts the following standalone options:

  * `:no_set`: it returns the current defaults stablished by the equation of state.
  * `:ashrae`: h = s = 0 at -40째C saturated liquid
  * `:iir`: h = 200.0 kJ/kg, s=1.0 kJ/kg/K at 0C saturated liquid
  * `:nbp`: h = s = 0 at 1 atm saturated liquid
  * `:stp`: h = s = 0 at 1 bar, 0째C fluid of the most stable phase
  * `:stp_old`: h = s = 0 at 1 atm, 0째C fluid of the most stable phase
  * `:ntp`: h = s = 0 at 1 atm, 20째C fluid of the most stable phase

it also accepts the following options, that require additional specifications:

  * `:volume` h = H0, s = S0, at T = T0, v = `volume(model,P0,T0,z0,phase = phase)`
  * `:saturation_pressure` h = H0, s = S0, at T = T0, saturated phase (specified by the `phase` argument)
  * `:saturation_temperature` h = H0, s = S0, at p = P0, saturated phase (specified by the `phase` argument)

If `z0` is not specified, the reference state calculation will be done for each component separately.

## Examples

```
julia> model = PCSAFT(["water","pentane"],idealmodel = ReidIdeal,reference_state = ReferenceState(:nbp))
PCSAFT{ReidIdeal, Float64} with 2 components:
 "water"
 "pentane"
Contains parameters: Mw, segment, sigma, epsilon, epsilon_assoc, bondvol

julia> model2 = PCSAFT(["water","pentane"],idealmodel = ReidIdeal,reference_state = :nbp) #equivalent

 "water"
 "pentane"
Contains parameters: Mw, segment, sigma, epsilon, epsilon_assoc, bondvol

julia> pure = split_model(model)
2-element Vector{PCSAFT{ReidIdeal, Float64}}:
