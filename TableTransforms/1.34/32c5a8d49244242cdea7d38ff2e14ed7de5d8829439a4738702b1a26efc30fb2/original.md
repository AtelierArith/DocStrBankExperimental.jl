```
Map(cols₁ => fun₁ => target₁, cols₂ => fun₂, ..., colsₙ => funₙ => targetₙ)
```

Applies the `funᵢ` function to the columns selected by `colsᵢ` using  the `map` function and saves the result in a new column named `targetᵢ`.

The column selection can be a single column identifier (index or name), a collection of identifiers or a regular expression (regex).

Passing a target column name is optional and when omitted a new name is generated by joining the function name with the selected column names. If the target column already exists in the table, the original column will be replaced.

# Examples

```julia
Map(1 => sin)
Map(:a => sin, "b" => cos => :cos_b)
Map([2, 3] => ((b, c) -> 2b + c))
Map([:a, :c] => ((a, c) -> 2a * 3c) => :col1)
Map(["c", "a"] => ((c, a) -> 3c / a) => :col1, "c" => tan)
Map(r"[abc]" => ((a, b, c) -> a^2 - 2b + c) => "col1")
```

## Notes

  * Anonymous functions must be passed with parentheses as in the examples above;
  * Some function names are treated in a special way, they are:

      * Anonymous functions: `#1` -> `f1`;
      * Composed functions: `outer ∘ inner` -> `outer_inner`;
      * `Base.Fix1` functions: `Base.Fix1(f, x)` -> `fix1_f`;
      * `Base.Fix2` functions: `Base.Fix2(f, x)` -> `fix2_f`;
