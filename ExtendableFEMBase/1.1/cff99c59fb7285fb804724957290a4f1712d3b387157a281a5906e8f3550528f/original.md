Interpolates (operator-evaluations of) the given finite element function into the finite element space assigned to the target FEVectorBlock.  (Currently not the most efficient way as it is based on the PointEvaluation pattern and cell search. If CellParents are available in the grid components of the target grid, these parent cell information can be used to improve the search. To activate this put 'use_cellparents' = true). By some given kernel function that is conforming to the interface

```
kernel!(result, input, qpinfo)
```

the operator evaluation (=input) can be further postprocessed. The qpinfo argument allows to access information at the current quadrature point.

Note: discontinuous quantities at vertices of the target grid will be evaluated in the first found cell of the source grid. No averaging is performed. With eps the tolerances of the cell search via ExtendableGrids.CellFinder can be steered.
