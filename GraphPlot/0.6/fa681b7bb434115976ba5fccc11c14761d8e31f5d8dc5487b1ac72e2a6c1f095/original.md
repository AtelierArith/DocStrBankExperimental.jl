Position nodes uniformly at random in the unit square. For every node, a position is generated by choosing each of dim coordinates uniformly at random on the interval [0.0, 1.0).

**Parameters**

*G* graph or list of nodes, A position will be assigned to every node in G

**Return**

*locs*x, locs*y* Locations of the nodes. Can be any units you want, but will be normalized and centered anyway

**Examples**

```
julia> g = simple_house_graph()

julia> loc_x, loc_y = random_layout(g)
```
