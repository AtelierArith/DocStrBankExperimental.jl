Attempts to find a color to match any name you give it. First by using the methods from Color.jl's @colorant_str macro, to handle things like `colorant"#cd32cd"` Then if that fails, does a lookup in the big list of named colors. If that fails, then it provides suggestions for what color name you may have meant. As an user, you basically should just use this, without worrying if a color is defined. There are almost 3500 defined colors, and if you miss one, then the suggestions will help you out. (this is easier than trying to workout the name yourself)
