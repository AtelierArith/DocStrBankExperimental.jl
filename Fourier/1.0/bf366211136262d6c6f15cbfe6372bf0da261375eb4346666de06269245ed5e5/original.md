```
fftrange(n)
```

Computes a range that always matches FFT expectations.  I.e., for even N ranges matches the example n=4 => -2:1:1 and for odd N matches the example 5 => -2:1:2.

This can be understood as "the output range shall always contain zero, if there may be only one value for nรท2, it will be the negative one."

The range is always centered; frequency or sampling bins align to it with fftshift.  It can be fftshifted to be placed in post-FFT coordinates.
