```
fisheye(f)
```

Transform `f` defined on `(-∞, ∞)` to a new function whose domain is in `(-π/2, π/2)` and range is within `(-π/2, π/2)`. Useful for finding all zeros over the real line. For example

```
f(x) = 1 + 100x^2 - x^3
fzeros(f, -100, 100) # empty just misses the zero found with:
fzeros(fisheye(f), -pi/2, pi/2) .|> tan  # finds 100.19469143521222, not perfect but easy to get
```
