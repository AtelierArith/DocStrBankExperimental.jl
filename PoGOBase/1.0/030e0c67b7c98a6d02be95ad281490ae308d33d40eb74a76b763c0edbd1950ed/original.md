```
only_pokemon(name::AbstractString; exact=false, equiv=false, kwargs...) â†’ species
```

Return the `Species` object that matches the given name, and throw an error if more than one matches.

If `exact` is `true`, only exact matches of the name are considered. If `equiv` is `true`, an error is not thrown if all matches are equivalent in their types, base stats, and moves.
