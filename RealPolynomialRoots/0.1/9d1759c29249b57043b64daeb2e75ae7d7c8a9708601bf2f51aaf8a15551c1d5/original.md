refine_interval(p, a, b, L)
refine_roots(st::State)
```

A method to find isolating intervals for the real roots of a square-free polynomial specified by the cofficients stored in `p`.

  * `p`: the polynomial coefficients, `[a‚ÇÄ, a‚ÇÅ, ‚Ä¶, a‚Çô]`, of a **square-free** polynomial.
  * `root_bound`: a lower bound and upper bound for the real roots.

Returns a `State` instance which has components:

  * `Isol` holding the isolating intervals. Iteration over a `State` object will iterate over `Isol`.
  * `Unresolved` holding any unresolved intervals. The show method alerts the presence of any such intervals.

The algorithm has a random step included, which leads to small variations in the output.

## Refinement

The `refine_interval` method can be used to refine an interval to have width smaller than $2^{-L}$ where `L` may be specified, but otherwise comes from the intervals precision.

Alternatively, a package like `Roots` could be used; e.g: `[find_zero(st, I) for I ‚àà st]` (where `st` is a `State` object returned by `ANewDsc`). If refinement over `Float64` values is desired and appropriate given the root separation, then that call can be modified, as with `[find_zero(st, Float64.(I)) for I ‚àà st]`. (This should produce roots with a sign change between `nextfloat` and `prevfloat`.)

## Comparisons

Don't judge the algorithm by its implementation here. This implementation is not as performant as it could be.

Comparing to some alternatives, we have that the functionality from Hecke.jl (`Hecke._roots`) is **much** better. (The last example is 33 ‚âà 0.14s/0.0042 times faster)

However, compared to other alternatives this implementation could be seen as useful:

```

julia> p = -1 + 254*x - 16129*x^2 + x^15;

julia> ANewDsc(coeffs(p))  # ‚âà 0.05 seconds;

The algorithm used is a partial implementation of one presented in:

*Computing Real Roots of Real Polynomials ... and now For Real!* by Alexander Kobel, Fabrice Rouillier, Michael Sagraloff [arXiv](https://arXiv.org/1605.00410); [DOI:](https://doi.org/10.1145/2930889.2930937).

and

*Computing real roots of real polynomials* Michael Sagraloff, Kurt Mehlhorn [DOI:](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsc.2015.03.004)

The algorithm relies on Descartes' rule of signs, which gives a bound on the number of positive real roots of a polynomial, `p(x)`. By considering the polynomial `p((ax+b)/(x+1))` (a mapping of `[a,b]` to `[0,‚àû)` a bound on the number of roots in `[a,b]` can be found. A simple bisection algorithm for a square-free polynomial would be to start with an interval large enough to contain all the real roots, then subdivide at the midpoint throwing out sub intervals which are found to have no root; saving intervals known to have 1 root, and repeating the subdivision otherwise. Issues with this are the need for many subdivisions when clusters of roots are present and the numeric issues that arise in computing the mapping.

The work of Sagaraloff, Melhorn, Kobel, and Rouillier improves this by introducing a Newton test and boundary test for rapidly decreasing the size of an interval when possible, and the ability to use finite precision arithmetic, instead of exact arithmetic, to compute the Descartes' bound, in addition to other algorithmic improvements (not all implemented here).

!!! note
    A square free polynomial can be found through `p/gcd(p, p')`, though in practice this calculation is numerically unstable.


!!! note
    This implementation is **much** slower than the `Hecke.roots` function provided through `arblib` in `Hecke.jl`, which itself says is not competitive with more specialized implementations, such as provided by the paper authors (http://anewdsc.mpi-inf.mpg.de/). There are several reasons: The `mobius_transform!` function is `ùë∂(n¬≤)`, and could be `ùë∂(n‚ãÖlog(n))` with more effort; the polynomial evaluation in `admissiblepoint` could, similarly, be made more efficient; despite using tricks learned from the `MutableArithmetics.jl` package to reduce allocations with the `BigFloat` type, there are still *far* too many allocations as each time the precision is changed new (allocating) values must be created, as the old ones can't be modified in place (using `set_prec!` causes segfaults); the significant engineering speedups suggested by Kobel, Rouillier, and Sagraloff are not implemented; etc.
