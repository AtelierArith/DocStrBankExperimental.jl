Calculates the relaxationMap based on the pixel values of the image

...

# Arguments

  * `image::Matrix` : Image whose values determine the relaxationrate at each pixel.
  * `minRelaxation::Float64=5.0` : minimum relaxationrate measured in [Hz]
  * `maxRelaxation::Float64=125.0` : maximum relaxationrate measured in [Hz]
