```
nuttall(N::Int, T::DataType=Float32) -> AbstractArray
Sidelobe peak attenuation = 93.8dB
```

The window is minimum in the sense that its maximum sidelobes are minimized. The coefficients for this window differ from the Blackman-Harris window coefficients computed with blackmanharris and produce slightly lower sidelobes.
