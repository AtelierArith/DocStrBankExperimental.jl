```
jtheta_ab(a, b, z, q)
```

Jacobi theta function with characteristics. This is a family of functions parameterized by `a` and `b`, which contains the opposite of the first Jacobi  theta function (`a=b=0.5`), the second Jacobi theta function (`a=0.5,b=0`),  the third Jacobi theta function (`a=b=0`), and the fourth Jacobi theta  function (`a=0,b=0.5`).

# Arguments

  * `a`: first characteristic, a real or complex number
  * `b`: second characteristic, a real or complex number
  * `z`: real or complex number or array of numbers
  * `q`: the nome
