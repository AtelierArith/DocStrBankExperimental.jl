```
quantization(X, levels; minv=0, maxv=1)
```

Returns array `X` discretized to `levels` different values. Therefore the array is discretized. `levels` describes how many different value steps the resulting image has. `minv=0` and `maxv` indicate the minimum and maximum possible values of the images. In RGB and Gray images this is usually 0 and 1. There is also `quantization!` available.
