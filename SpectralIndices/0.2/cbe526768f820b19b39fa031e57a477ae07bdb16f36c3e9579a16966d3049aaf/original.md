```
Band(band::Dict{String, Any})
```

Constructs a `Band` object to interact with specific bands in the list of required bands for Spectral Indices in the Awesome Spectral Indices list.

# Arguments

  * `band::Dict{String, Any}`: A dictionary containing band information with the following keys:

      * `"short_name"`: Short name of the band.
      * `"long_name"`: Description or name of the band.
      * `"common_name"`: Common name of the band according to the Electro-Optical Extension Specification for STAC.
      * `"min_wavelength"`: Minimum wavelength of the spectral range of the band (in nm).
      * `"max_wavelength"`: Maximum wavelength of the spectral range of the band (in nm).
      * `"platforms"`: A dictionary of platform information associated with this band.

# Returns

A `Band` object representing the specified band.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> bands["B"]
band_dict = Dict{String, Any}(
    "short_name" => "B",
    "long_name" => "Blue",
    "common_name" => "Blue",
    "min_wavelength" => 450.0,
    "max_wavelength" => 495.0,
    "platforms" => Dict{String, Any}(
        "sentinel2a" => PlatformBand(...),  # PlatformBand constructor details here
        "sentinel2b" => PlatformBand(...),  # PlatformBand constructor details here
        # Add other platforms as needed
    )
)

band = Band(band_dict)
```

Or, using the provided bands

```julia-repl
julia> bands["B"].long_name

```
