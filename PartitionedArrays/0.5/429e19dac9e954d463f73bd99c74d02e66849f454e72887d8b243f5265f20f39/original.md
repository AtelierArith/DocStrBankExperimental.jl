```
LocalIndices(n_global,owner,local_to_global,local_to_owner)
```

Build an instance of [`LocalIndices`](@ref) from the underlying properties `n_global`, `owner`, `local_to_global`, and `local_to_owner`.  The types of these variables need to match the type of the properties in [`LocalIndices`](@ref).
