If optional keyword parameter `nonlinear` is false (default), estimate linear [(weighted) coherence](@ref) measure, otherwise estimate the the [(weighted) phase concentration](@ref) measure.

If optional keyword argument `allkinds` is true all five [kinds of coherence](@ref) are returned. In this case the output is a 5-tuple of `Coherence` matrices, in the order:

  * *total* coherence,
  * *real* coherence,
  * *instantaneous* coherence
  * *imaginary* coherence,
  * *lagged* coherence.

If `allkinds` is false (default) only the *total* (classical) coherence is returned as a single `Coherence` matrix.

(5) The desired measure is obtained averaging across the [TFAnalyticSignal](@ref) objects in `ùêô`. Since this method uses pre-computed analytic signal objects, their `.nonlinear` field must agree with the `nonlinear` argument passed to this function.

`frange`, `trange`, `w`, `mode` and `func` have the same meaning as in the [`meanAmplitude`](@ref) function, however keep in mind that the two possible `mode` functions, i.e., [`extract`](@ref) and [`mean`](@ref), in this function operate on complex numbers.

The checks performed in the [`meanAmplitude`](@ref) function are performed here too. In addition, if `check` is true, also check that

  * if `nonlinear` is true, all objects in `ùêô` are nonlinear;
  * if `nonlinear` is false, all objects in `ùêô` are linear.

If either check fails, print an error message and return `Nothing`.

(6) Estimate the analytic signal of all data vectors in `ùê±` calling the [`TFanalyticsignal`](@ref) constructor and then use method (5) to obtained the desired measure.

`frange`, `trange`, `mode`, `func`, `w` and `check` have the same meaning as in the [`meanAmplitude`](@ref) function. The other arguments are passed to the [`TFanalyticsignal`](@ref) constructor, to which the reader is referred for understanding their action.

**See also**: [`meanAmplitude`](@ref), [`meanDirection`](@ref), [timefrequencybi.jl](@ref).

**Examples**: see the examples of [`comodulation`](@ref) function.
