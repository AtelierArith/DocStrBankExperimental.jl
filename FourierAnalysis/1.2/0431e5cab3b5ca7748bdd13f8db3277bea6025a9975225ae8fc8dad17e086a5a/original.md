(1)

Construct a [Coherence](@ref) object from a [CrossSpectra](@ref) object, allowing coherence estimates using the Welch method. All non-data fields are copied from the cross-spectra object, i.e., all fields but `y`, which holds the coherence matrices that are computed by this function.

If `ùôé.tril` is true, only the lower triangular part of the coherence matrices is computed and the matrices in `y` are LowerTriangular matrices, otherwise the full matrices are computed and `y` will hold Hermitian matrices (see [LinearAlgebra](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/#Linear-Algebra-1)).

If optional keyword argument `allkinds` is true, all five [kinds of coherence](@ref) are returned. In this case the output is a 5-tuple of Coherence objects, in the order:

  * *total* coherence,
  * *real* coherence,
  * *instantaneous* coherence
  * *imaginary* coherence,
  * *lagged* coherence.

If `allkinds` is false (default), only the *total* (classical) coherence is returned as a single `Coherence` object.

(2)

Construct a [CoherenceVector](@ref) object from the input [CrossSpectraVector](@ref) object `ùì¢`, allowing coherence estimates using the Welch method. This method calls method (1) for all objects in `ùì¢`.

The `allkinds` optional keyword parameter has the same meaning as in method (1). In this method if the argument is passed as true, the output is a 5-tuple of `CoherenceVector` objects.

If optional keyword argument `check` is true (default), it is checked that all `CrossSpectra` objects in `ùì¢` have the same value in the ``.sr`, `.wl`, `.DC`, `.taper`, `.nonlinear` and `.smoothing` field. If this is not the case, an error message is printed pointing to the first field that is not identical in all objects and `Nothing` is returned.

(3)

Given a multivariate time series data matrix `X` of dimension $t$ x $n$, where $t$ is the number of samples (rows) and $n$ the number of time-series (columns), sampling rate `sr` and epoch length `wl`, compute the squared coherence matrices of `X`, that is, the coherence matrices at all Fourier discrete frequencies obtained from the Welch (sliding window) average cross-spectra.

**optioal keyword arguments**:

`sr`, `wl`, `tapering`, `planner` and `slide` have the same meaning as for the [`spectra`](@ref) function.

`DC`, `nonlinear`, `smoothing`, `tril` and `‚è©` have the same meaning as for the [`crossSpectra`](@ref) function, to which they apply for estimating the cross-spectra.

The `allkinds` optional keyword parameter has the same meaning as in method (1).

(4)

Construct a [CoherenceVector](@ref) object from a vector of real multivariate data matrices. Compute the coherence matrices from the cross-spectral matrices estimated using the Welch method as per method (3) for all $k$ data matrices in `ùêó`.

The $k$ matrices in `ùêó` must have the same number of columns (*i.e.*, the same number of time-series), but may have any number of (at least `wl`) rows (samples). All other arguments have the same meaning as in method (3), with the following difference:

`‚è©`: if true (default), the method is run in multi-threaded mode across the $k$ data matrices if $k$ is at least twice the number of threads Julia is instructed to use, otherwise this method attempts to run each coherence estimation in multi-threaded mode across series as per method (3). See [Threads](@ref).

If a `Planner` is not explicitly passed as an argument, the FFTW plan is computed once and applied for all coherence estimations.

**note for methods (1) and (3)**:

If `tril` is false (default), the output coherence object(s) is of type `Array{Hermitian,1}`, which is the `‚ÑçVector` type used in package [PosDefManifold](https://github.com/Marco-Congedo/PosDefManifold.jl). Since coherence estimates are symmetric positive definite, they can be straightaway used as argument to PosDefManifold's functions, e.g., for computing matrix moves on [geodesics](https://marco-congedo.github.io/PosDefManifold.jl/dev/riemannianGeometry/#Geodesic-equations-1), matrix [distances](https://marco-congedo.github.io/PosDefManifold.jl/dev/riemannianGeometry/#PosDefManifold.distance), etc. and the the whole vector output to compute matrix [means](https://marco-congedo.github.io/PosDefManifold.jl/dev/riemannianGeometry/#Means-1), [spectral embedding](https://marco-congedo.github.io/PosDefManifold.jl/dev/riemannianGeometry/#PosDefManifold.spectralEmbedding) and more.

If `tril` is true, the output is of type `Array{LowerTriangular,1}`, which is the `ùïÉVector` type used in PosDefManifold, that is, only the lower triangle of the coherencee is computed in order to save time and memory.

**note for methods (2) and (4)**:

If `tril` is false, the output is of type `Array{Array{Hermitian,1},1}`, which is the `‚ÑçVector‚ÇÇ` type used in [PosDefManifold](https://github.com/Marco-Congedo/PosDefManifold.jl).

If `tril` is true, the output is of type `Array{Array{LowerTriangular,1},1}`, which is the `ùïÉVector‚ÇÇ` type used in PosDefManifold.
