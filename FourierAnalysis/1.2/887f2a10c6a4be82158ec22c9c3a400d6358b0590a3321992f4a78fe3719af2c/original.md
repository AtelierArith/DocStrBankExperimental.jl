Generate labels for the axes to be used in heatmap plots of [TFobjects](@ref). On the y-axis the labels correspond to the center frequencies of the band-pass filter bank used to obtain the time-frequency representation, that is, to the `.flabels` field of the object.

See [plot time-frequency objects](@ref) for examples.
