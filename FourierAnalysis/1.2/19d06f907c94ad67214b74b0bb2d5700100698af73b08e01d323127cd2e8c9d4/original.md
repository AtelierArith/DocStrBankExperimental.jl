(1)

Given a pair of [TFAmplitudeVector](@ref) objects, estimate their [(weighted) comodulation](@ref) measure. `ùêÄ‚ÇÅ` and `ùêÄ‚ÇÇ` must hold the same number of objects and the time-frequency planes of all the objects should be congruent.

**arguments**:

`frange` and `trange` have the same meaning as in the [`meanAmplitude`](@ref) method.

**optional keyword arguments**

`mode`, `func` and `check` have the same meaning as in the [`meanAmplitude`](@ref) method.

`w` may be a vector of non-negative real weights associated to each pair of input objects. By default the unweighted version of the measure is computed.

(2)

Given a pair of [TFAnalyticSignalVector](@ref) object, compute the amplitude of all objects and estimate the [(weighted) comodulation](@ref) as per method (1). Like in method (1), `ùêô‚ÇÅ` and `ùêô‚ÇÇ` must hold the same number of objects and the time-frequency planes of all the objects should be congruent. In addition, since using this method all [TFAnalyticSignal](@ref) objects in `ùêô‚ÇÅ` and `ùêô‚ÇÇ` must be `linear`, if `check` is true (default) and this is not the case, print an error and return `Nothing`. The checks on `frange` and `trange` performed by method (1) are also performed by this method.

(3)

Estimate the amplitude of all data vectors in `ùê±‚ÇÅ` and `ùê±‚ÇÇ` calling the [`TFamplitude`](@ref) constructor and then estimate the [(weighted) comodulation](@ref) measure across the constructed amplitude objects as per method (1).

`frange`, `trange`, `mode`, `func`, `w` and `check` have the same meaning as in method (1). The other arguments are passed to the [`TFamplitude`](@ref) constructors, to which the reader is referred for their meaning.

If a `planner` for FFT computations is not provided, it is computed once and applied for all amplitude estimations.
