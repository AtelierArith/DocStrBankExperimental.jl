(1)

Construct a [CrossSpectra](@ref) objects from real multivariate data using the Welch method.

Given sampling rate `sr` and epoch length `wl`, compute the cross-spectral matrices of dimension $n$x$n$ for a multivariate data matrix `X` of dimension $t$x$n$, where $t$ is the number of samples (rows) and `n>1` is the number of time-series (columns).

The cross-spectral matrices are hold in the `.y` vector field of the created object. The length of `.y` depends upon the `wl` argument and `DC` optional keyword argument (see below).

**Optional Keyword Arguments**:

`sr`, `wl`, `tapering`, `planner` and `slide` have the same meaning as for the [`spectra`](@ref) function.

`DC`: if true the cross-spectral matrix of the DC level is returned in the first position of `y` (see the fields of the [CrossSpectra](@ref) object), otherwise (default) the matrices in `y` start with the first positive discrete frequency, that is, $sr/wl$ Hz.

`nonlinear`: if true, the amplitude information is eliminated from the DFT coefficients, that is, they are normalized by their modulus before being averaged. This leads to non-linear estimates (Congedo, 2018; Pascual-Marqui 2007) where the diagonal elements of the cross-spectral matrices (the spectra) are 1.0 for all frequencies. By default, it is false.

`smoothing`: apply a smoothing function of type [Smoother](@ref) to the cross-spectral matrices across frequencies. By default no smoothing is applied.

`tril`: if false (default), the whole cross-spectra matrices will be computed, otherwise only their lower triangular part (see below).

`‚è©`: if true (default), the method is run in multi-threaded mode across the series in `X` if the number of series is at least twice the number of threads Julia is instructed to use. See [Threads](@ref).

**Return**

If `tril` is false (default), the output is of type `Array{Hermitian,1}`, which is the `‚ÑçVector` type used in package [PosDefManifold](https://github.com/Marco-Congedo/PosDefManifold.jl). Since cross-spectral estimates are Hermitian positive definite, they can be straightaway used as argument to PosDefManifold's functions, e.g., for computing matrix moves on [geodesics](https://marco-congedo.github.io/PosDefManifold.jl/dev/riemannianGeometry/#Geodesic-equations-1), matrix [distances](https://marco-congedo.github.io/PosDefManifold.jl/dev/riemannianGeometry/#PosDefManifold.distance), etc. and the the whole vector output to compute matrix [means](https://marco-congedo.github.io/PosDefManifold.jl/dev/riemannianGeometry/#Means-1), [spectral embedding](https://marco-congedo.github.io/PosDefManifold.jl/dev/riemannianGeometry/#PosDefManifold.spectralEmbedding) and more.

If `tril` is true, the output is of type `Array{LowerTriangular,1}`, which is the `ùïÉVector` type used in PosDefManifold, that is, only the lower triangle of the cross-spectra is computed in order to save time and memory.

(2)

Construct a [CrossSpectraVector](@ref) object from a vector of real multivariate data matrices. Compute the cross-spectral matrices using the Welch method as per method (1) for all $k$ data matrices in `ùêó`.

The $k$ matrices in `ùêó` must have the same number of columns (i.e., the same number of time-series), but may have any number of (at least `wl`) rows (samples). All other arguments have the same meaning as in method (1), with the following difference:

`‚è©`: if true (default), the method is run in multi-threaded mode across the $k$ data matrices if $k$ is at least twice the number of threads Julia is instructed to use, otherwise this method attempts to run each cross-spectral estimation in multi-threaded mode across series as per method (1). See [Threads](@ref).

If a `planner` is not explicitly passed as an argument, the FFTW plan is computed once and applied for all cross-spectral estimations.

**Return**

If `tril` is false, the output is of type `Array{Array{Hermitian,1},1}`, which is the `‚ÑçVector‚ÇÇ` type used in [PosDefManifold](https://github.com/Marco-Congedo/PosDefManifold.jl).

If `tril` is true, the output is of type `Array{Array{LowerTriangular,1},1}`, which is the `ùïÉVector‚ÇÇ` type used in PosDefManifold.
