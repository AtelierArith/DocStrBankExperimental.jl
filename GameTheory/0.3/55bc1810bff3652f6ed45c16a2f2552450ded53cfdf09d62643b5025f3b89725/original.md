```
covariance_game([rng=GLOBAL_RNG], nums_actions, rho)
```

Return a random N-player NormalFormGame instance with N>=2 where the payoff profiles are drawn independently from the standard multi-normal with the covariance of any pair of payoffs equal to `rho`, as studied in Rinott and Scarsini (2000).

# Arguments

  * `rng::AbstractRNG=GLOBAL_RNG`: Random number generator used.
  * `nums_actions::NTuple{N,Int}`: Tuple of the numbers of actions, one for each player.
  * `rho::Real`: Covariance of a pair of payoff values. Must be in [-1/(N-1), 1], where N is the number of players.

# Returns

  * `::NormalFormGame`: The generated random N-player NormalFormGame.

# Examples

julia> using GameTheory, Random

julia> rng = MersenneTwister(12345);

julia> g = covariance_game(rng, (4, 3), -0.7);
