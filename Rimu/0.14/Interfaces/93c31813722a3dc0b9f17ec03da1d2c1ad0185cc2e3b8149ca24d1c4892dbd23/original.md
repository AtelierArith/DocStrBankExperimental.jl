```
apply_operator!(working_memory, target, source, operator, boost=1, compress=Val(true)) ->
    stat_names, stats, working_memory, target
```

Perform a single matrix(/operator)-vector multiplication:

$$
v^{(n + 1)} = \hat{T} v^{(n)} ,
$$

where $\hat{T}$ is the `operator`, $v^{(n+1)}$ is the `target` and $v^{(n)}$ is the `source`. The `working_memory` can be used as temporary storage.

The `boost` argument is passed to [`apply_column!`](@ref) and increases the number of spawns performed. For the operator to be applied without compressing the vector after, set `compress` to `Val(false)`.

Whether the operation is performed in a stochastic, semistochastic, or determistic way is controlled by the trait `StochasticStyle(target)`. See [`StochasticStyle`](@ref).

Returns the step stats generated by the `StochasticStyle`, the working memory and the `target` vector. `target` and `working_memory` may be mutated and/or swapped.
