```
QueryTruthTable(fml::Function, props::Vector{QueryLiteral}) -> QueryTruthTable
```

Truth table evaluator for query match and containment. 

This is expected to be generated by using `generate_truthtable`. Note that the properties must be unique and sorted if QueryTruthTable constructors is manually called for testing.

  * function: function that takes a vector whose size is `length(props)` that corresponds to each property variables and returns true or false.
  * props: QueryLiteral vector.
