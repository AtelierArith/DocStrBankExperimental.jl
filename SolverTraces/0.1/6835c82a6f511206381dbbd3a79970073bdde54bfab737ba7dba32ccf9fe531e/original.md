Performance(load, header, tâ‚€, fmt)
```

This trace column can be used to indicate the performance of a calculation, i.e. how many units (grid points, particles, &c) can the algorithm handle per second. The number is shifted to the appropriate order of magnitude, changing the SI prefix to e.g. `kHz`, `MHz`, &c.
