```
apply_t_grad!(climate::RasterStack, dem::Raster)
```

Apply temperature gradients to the climate data based on the digital elevation model (DEM).

# Arguments

  * `climate::RasterStack`: A `RasterStack` object containing climate data, including temperature and gradient information.
  * `dem::Raster`: A `Raster` object representing the digital elevation model (DEM) data.

# Description

This function adjusts the temperature data in the `climate` object by applying the temperature gradients. The adjustment is based on the difference between the mean elevation from the DEM data and a reference height specified in the metadata of the `climate` object.
