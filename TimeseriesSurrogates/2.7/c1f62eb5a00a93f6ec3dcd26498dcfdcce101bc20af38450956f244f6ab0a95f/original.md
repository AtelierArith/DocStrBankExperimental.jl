AAFT()
```

An amplitude-adjusted-fourier-transform (AAFT) surrogate[^Theiler1991].

AAFT surrogates have the same linear correlation, or periodogram, and also preserves the amplitude distribution of the original data.

AAFT surrogates can be used to test the null hypothesis that the data come from a monotonic nonlinear transformation of a linear Gaussian process (also called integrated white noise)[^Theiler1991].
