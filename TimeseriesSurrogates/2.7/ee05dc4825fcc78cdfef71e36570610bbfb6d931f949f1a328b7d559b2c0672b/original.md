[`IrregularLombScargle`](@ref) surrogates for unevenly sampled time series  with supporting time steps `t`, generated using the simulated annealing algorithm  described in [^SchreiberSchmitz1999].

[`IrregularLombScargle`](@ref) surrogates (given enough iterations and a low enough  tolerance) preserve the periodogram and the amplitude  distribution of the original signal. For time series with equidistant time steps,  surrogates generated by this method result in surrogates similar to those produced  by the [`IAAFT`](@ref) method.

This algorithm starts with a random permutation of the original data. Then it iteratively  approaches the power spectrum of the original data by swapping two randomly selected values  in the surrogate data if the Minkowski distance of order `q` between the power spectrum of  the surrogate data and the original data is less than before. The iteration procedure ends  when the relative deviation between the periodograms is less than `tol` or when `n_total`  number of tries or `n_acc` number of actual swaps is reached.
