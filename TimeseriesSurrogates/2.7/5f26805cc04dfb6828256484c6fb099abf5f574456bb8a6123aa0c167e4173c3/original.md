CycleShuffle(n::Int = 7, σ = 0.5)
```

Cycle shuffled surrogates[^Theiler1994] that identify successive local peaks in the data and shuffle the cycles in-between the peaks. Similar to [`BlockShuffle`](@ref), but here the "blocks" are defined as follows:

1. The timeseries is smoothened via convolution with a Gaussian (`DSP.gaussian(n, σ)`).
2. Local maxima of the smoothened signal define the peaks, and thus the blocks in between them.
3. The first and last index of timeseries can never be peaks and thus signals that should have peaks very close to start or end of the timeseries may not perform well. In addition, points before the first or after the last peak are never shuffled.
4. The defined blocks are randomly shuffled as in [`BlockShuffle`](@ref).

CSS are used to test the null hypothesis that the signal is generated by a periodic oscillator with no dynamical correlation between cycles, i.e. the evolution of cycles is not deterministic.

See also [`PseudoPeriodic`](@ref).
