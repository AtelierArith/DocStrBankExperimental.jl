```
CircShift(n)
```

Surrogates that are circularly shifted versions of the original timeseries.

`n` can be an integer (the surrogate is the original time series shifted  by `n` indices), or any vector of integers, which which means that each  surrogate is shifted by an integer selected randomly among the entries in `n`.
