Money Flow Index (MFI)

Uses both price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure. It is positive when the typical price rises (buying pressure) and negative when the typical price declines (selling pressure). A ratio of positive and negative money flow is then plugged into an RSI formula to create an oscillator that moves between zero and one hundred.
