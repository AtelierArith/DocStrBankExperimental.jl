[Supergalactic Coordinate System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergalactic_coordinate_system)

The supergalactic plane is part of a reference frame for the supercluster of galaxies that contains the Milky Way galaxy. The supergalactic plane as so-far observed is more or less perpendicular to the plane of the Milky Way, the angle is 84.5 degrees. Viewed from the Earth, the plane traces a great circle across the sky through the constellations 

# Coordinates

  * `l` - SuperGalCoords longitude in radians (-π, π)
  * `b` - SuperGalCoords latitude in radians (-π/2, π/2)
