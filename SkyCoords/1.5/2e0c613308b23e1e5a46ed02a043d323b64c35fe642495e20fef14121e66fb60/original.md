[Equatorial Coordinate System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_coordinate_system)

This coordinate system maps the celestial sphere based on a geocentric observer. Historically the oldest, this coordinate system has been shown to be inaccurate due to its definitions based on the Earth, which has long-scale precession causing the reference frame to change. Because of this, an equinox must be provided (typically 2000, commonly known as J2000) which defines the reference frame.

# Coordinates

  * `ra` - Right ascension in radians (0, 2π)
  * `dec` - Declination in radians (-π/2, π/2)
