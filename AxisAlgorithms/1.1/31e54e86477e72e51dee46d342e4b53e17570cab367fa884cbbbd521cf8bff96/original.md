`A_ldiv_B_md!(dest, F, src, dim)` solves a tridiagonal system along dimension `dim` of `src`, storing the result in `dest`. Currently, `F` must be an LU-factorized tridiagonal matrix. If desired, you may safely use the same array for both `src` and `dest`, so that this becomes an in-place algorithm.
