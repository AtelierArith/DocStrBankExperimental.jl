`A_mul_B_perm!(dest, M, src, dim)` computes `M*x` for slices `x` of `src` along dimension `dim`, storing the result in `dest`. `M` must be an `AbstractMatrix`. This uses `permutedims` to make dimension `dim` into the first dimension, performs a standard matrix multiplication, and restores the original dimension ordering. In many cases, this algorithm exhibits the best cache behavior.
