```
Trapezoid(;length = 1.0, width = 1.0, ratio = 1.0)
```

Create a trapezoid with dimensions given by `length` and the larger `width` and the `ratio` between the smaller and larger widths. The trapezoid is generted at the standard location and orientation.

# Arguments

  * `length = 1.0`: The length of the trapezoid.
  * `width = 1.0`: The larger width of the trapezoid (the lower base of the trapezoid).
  * `ratio = 1.0`: The ratio between the smaller and larger widths.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Trapezoid(;length = 1.0, width = 1.0, ratio = 1.0);
```
