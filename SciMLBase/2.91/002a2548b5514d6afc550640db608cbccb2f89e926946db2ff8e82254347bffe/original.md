```julia
struct EnsembleProblem{T, T2, T3, T4, T5} <: SciMLBase.AbstractEnsembleProblem
```

Defines a structure to manage an ensemble (batch) of problems. Each field controls how the ensemble behaves during simulation.

## Arguments

```
- `prob`: The original base problem to replicate or modify.
- `prob_func`: A function that defines how to generate each subproblem.
- `output_func`: A function to post-process each individual simulation result.
- `reduction`: A function to combine results from all simulations.
- `u_init`: The initial container used to accumulate the results.
- `safetycopy`: Whether to copy the problem when creating subproblems (to avoid unintended modifications).
```
