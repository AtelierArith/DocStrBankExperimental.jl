```
intersect_interval(x, y)
```

Returns the intersection of the intervals `x` and `y`, considered as (extended) sets of real numbers. That is, the set that contains the points common in `x` and `y`.

The result is decorated by at most `trv` (Section 11.7.1).

Implement the `intersection` function of the IEEE Standard 1788-2015 (Section 9.3).
