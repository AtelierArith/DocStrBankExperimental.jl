hull(x, y)
```

Return the interval hull of the intervals `x` and `y`, considered as (extended) sets of real numbers, i.e. the smallest interval that contains all of `x` and `y`.

The result is decorated by at most `trv` (Section 11.7.1).

Implement the `convexHull` function of the IEEE Standard 1788-2015 (Section 9.3).
