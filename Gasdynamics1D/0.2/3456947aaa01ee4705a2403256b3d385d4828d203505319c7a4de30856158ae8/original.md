PressureRatio(Tr::TemperatureRatio,Isentropic[;gas=Air])
```

Compute the ratio of temperatures between two points connected isentropically, given the ratio of densities `dr` between those two points, using the isentropic relation

$\dfrac{p_2}{p_1} = \left(\dfrac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^{\gamma/(\gamma-1)}$
