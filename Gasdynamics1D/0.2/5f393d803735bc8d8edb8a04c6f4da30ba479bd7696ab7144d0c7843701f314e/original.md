DensityRatio(Tr::TemperatureRatio,Isentropic[;gas=Air])
```

Compute the ratio of densities between two points connected isentropically, given the ratio of temperatures `Tr` between those two points, using the isentropic relation

$\dfrac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} = \left(\dfrac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^{1/(\gamma-1)}$
