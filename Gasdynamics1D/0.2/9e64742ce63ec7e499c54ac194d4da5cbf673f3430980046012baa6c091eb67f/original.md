```
SoundSpeed(T::Temperature[,γ::SpecificHeatRatio=1.4][,R::GasConstant=287])
```

Compute the speed of sound of a perfect gas, based on the absolute temperature `T`. The ratio of specific heats `γ` and `R` can also be supplied, but default to the values for air at standard conditions (1.4 and 287 J/kg.K, respectively).
