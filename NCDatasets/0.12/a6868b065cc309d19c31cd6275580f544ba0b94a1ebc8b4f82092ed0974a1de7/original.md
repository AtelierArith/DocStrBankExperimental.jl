NCDatasets is a module to read and write NetCDF files. This is minimal example how to read a NetCDF file.

```julia
using NCDatasets
# open the file and show its metadata (if called in the REPL without ending semicolon)
ds = NCDataset("filename.nc","r")
# load all data of the variable temperature
v = ds["temperature"][:,:]
# load the attribute units
unit = v.attrib["units"]
# close the file
close(ds)
```
