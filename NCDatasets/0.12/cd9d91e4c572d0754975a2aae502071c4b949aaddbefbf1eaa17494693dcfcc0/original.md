```
 data = loadragged(ncvar,index::Union{Colon,UnitRange,Int})
```

Load data from `ncvar` in the [contiguous ragged array representation](https://web.archive.org/web/20190111092546/http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/v1.6.0/cf-conventions.html#_contiguous_ragged_array_representation) as a vector of vectors. It is typically used to load a list of profiles or time series of different length each.

The [indexed ragged array representation](https://web.archive.org/web/20190111092546/http://cfconventions.org/cf-conventions/v1.6.0/cf-conventions.html#_indexed_ragged_array_representation) is currently not supported.
