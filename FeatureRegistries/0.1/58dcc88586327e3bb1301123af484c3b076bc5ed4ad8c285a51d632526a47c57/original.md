```
find(registry, [; col = filter, ...])
```

Find entries in a registry that match a set of filters given as keyword arguments. The keyword name must correspond to a field in `registry`, while the value is a filter that is checked against each field value.

See [how to use registries](/documents/docs/using.md) for examples.
