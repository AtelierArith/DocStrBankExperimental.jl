`nₘₐₓ(model::MorsePotential)`

!!! note
    Note that the number of bound states is equal to the maximum quantum number `nₘₐₓ`, since we count the ground state from `n=1` in this model.


$$
n_\mathrm{max} = \left\lfloor \frac{2 D_e - \omega}{\omega} \right\rfloor,
$$

where $\omega = \sqrt{k/µ}$ is defined.
