```
struct VoronoiBinner{Dim, M, CRS}
```

Bin `Dim`-dimensional (where `Dim âˆˆ (1, 2)`) dataset based on a Voronoi tesellation of points generated by a k-means clustering of initial trajectory data (i.e. `Trajectories.x0`).

### Fields

  * `boundary`: A [`Boundary`](@ref) object.
  * `bins`: A [`Bins`](@ref) object.
  * `idx2pos`: A vector such that `idx2pos[i]` gives the position (in bins) of the bin initially (before removing dataless and disconnected bins) labelled `i`. `idx2pos[i] == nothing` if this bin was removed.

### Constructor

```
VoronoiBinner(nbins, boundary, traj; hardclip = true)
```
