```
struct DataReinjection
```

Reinject the data according to which bins are actually hit by transitions from the exterior to the interior. 

Since this is applied by default in the main Ulam's method algorithm, the associated `reinject!` function  for `DataReinjection` does nothing.

### Constructor

```
DataReinjection()
