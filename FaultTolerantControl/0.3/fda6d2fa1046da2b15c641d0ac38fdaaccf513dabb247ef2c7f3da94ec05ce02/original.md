Default weight: 1 for position, (1/π^2) for angular velocity (1 m ≈ 180 deg)

# Notes

  * Q_p: weight matrix for running cost (position)
  * Q_ω: weight matrix for running cost (angular velocity)
  * F_p: weight matrix for terminal cost (position)
  * F_ω: weight matrix for terminal cost (angular velocity)
