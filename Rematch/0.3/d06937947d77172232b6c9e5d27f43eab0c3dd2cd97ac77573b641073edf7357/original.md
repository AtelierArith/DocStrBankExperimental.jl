Patterns:

  * `_` matches anything
  * `foo` matches anything, binds value to `foo`
  * `Foo(x,y,z)` matches structs of type `Foo` with fields matching `x,y,z`
  * `Foo(y=1)` matches structs of type `Foo` whose `y` field equals `1`
  * `[x,y,z]` matches `AbstractArray`s with 3 entries matching `x,y,z`
  * `(x,y,z)` matches `Tuple`s with 3 entries matching `x,y,z`
  * `[x,y...,z]` matches `AbstractArray`s with at least 2 entries, where `x` matches the first entry, `z` matches the last entry and `y` matches the remaining entries.
  * `(x,y...,z)` matches `Tuple`s with at least 2 entries, where `x` matches the first entry, `z` matches the last entry and `y` matches the remaining entries.
  * `_::T` matches any subtype (`isa`) of T
  * `x || y` matches values which match either `x` or `y` (only variables which exist in both branches will be bound)
  * `x && y` matches values which match both `x` and `y`
  * `x where condition` matches only if `condition` is true (`condition` may use any variables that occur earlier in the pattern eg `(x, y, z where x + y > z)`)
  * Anything else is treated as a constant and tested for equality
  * Expressions can be interpolated in as constants via standard interpolation syntax `$(x)`

Patterns can be nested arbitrarily.

Repeated variables only match if they are equal (`==`). For example `(x,x)` matches `(1,1)` but not `(1,2)`.
