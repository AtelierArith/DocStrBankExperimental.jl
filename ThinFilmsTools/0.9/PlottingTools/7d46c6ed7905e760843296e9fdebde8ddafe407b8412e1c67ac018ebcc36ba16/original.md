Plot the EMF for depth and λ, at a given angle of incidence θ.

    plot(EMF2D(), λ, ℓ, emf; num_levels=80, s=(640,480))
    gui()

        λ: wavelength range
        ℓ: multilayer depth
        emf: electromagnetic field
            num_levels: number of levels for the contour plot
            s: size of the figure
