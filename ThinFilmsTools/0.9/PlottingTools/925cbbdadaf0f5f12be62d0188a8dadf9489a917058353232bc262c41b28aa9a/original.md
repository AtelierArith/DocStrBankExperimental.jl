```
Plots the photonic dispersion (Bloch wavevector) of a photonic crystal structure,
computed for a range of frequencies (wavelengths) and a range of angle of incidences.

    plot(PBGDispersion2Dalt(), solution.Bloch; s=(640,480), num_levels=90)
    gui()

        solution: solution structure from TMMOptics
            s: size of the figure
