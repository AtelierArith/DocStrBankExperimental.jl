```
AdhesionPenalty(J::Matrix{Int})
```

A concrete type that penalizes neighboring grid locations from different cells.

Requires a symmetric matrix `J` where `J[n,m]` gives the adhesion penality for cells with types n and m. `J` is zero-indexed meaning `J[0,1]` and `J[1,0]` corresponds to the `:Medium` â†” `:Cell1` adhesion penalty.

**Note**: `J` is automatically transformed to be a zero-indexed offset array.
