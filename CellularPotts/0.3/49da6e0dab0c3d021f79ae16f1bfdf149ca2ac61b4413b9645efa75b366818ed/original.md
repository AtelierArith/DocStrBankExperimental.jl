```
PerimeterPenalty(λᵥ::Vector{Int})
```

A concrete type that penalizes cells that deviate from their desired perimeter.

Requires a vector `λₚ` with n penalties where n is the number of cell types. `λₚ` is zero-indexed meaning `λₚ[0]` corresponds to the `:Medium` perimeter penalty (which is set to zero).

**Note**: `λₚ` is automatically transformed to be a zero-indexed offset array and does not require the perimeter penalty for `:Medium`.
