```
map_summaries(fun, path; purge=true, tags=all, steps=all, smart=true)
```

Maps the function `fun(name, value)` on all the values logged to the folder at `path`. The function is called sequentially, starting from the first event till the last.

When the keyword argument `purge==true`, if the i+1-th file begins with a purge at step `s`, the i-th file is read only up to step `s`.

`fun` should take 3 arguments:     (1) a String representing the name/tag of the logged value     (2) an Integer, representing the step number     (3) a value, which can be of the following types:

Optional kwargs `tags` takes as input a collection of Strings, and will only iterate across tags summaries with a tag in that collection.

Optional kwargs `steps` takes as input a collection of integers, and will only iterate across events with step within that collection.

Optional kwarg `smart=[true]` attempts to reconstruct N-dimensional arrays, complex values and 3-dim images, that are decomposed when serialzied to tensorboard. This feature works with .proto files generated by TensorBoardLogger itself, but it is untested with files generated by TensorFlow.
