Finite presentations of a model of a generalized algebraic theory (GAT).

We support two methods for defining models of a GAT: as Julia objects using the `@instance` macro and as syntactic objects using the `@present` macro. Instances are useful for casting generic data structures, such as matrices, abstract tensor systems, and wiring diagrams, in categorical language. Presentations define small categories by generators and relations and are useful in applications like knowledge representation.
