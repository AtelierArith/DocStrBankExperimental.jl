```
surfnm(a, b, c, point)
```

Computes the outward-pointing, unit normal vector from a point on the surface of an ellipsoid.

### Arguments

  * `a`: Length of the ellisoid semi-axis along the x-axis
  * `b`: Length of the ellisoid semi-axis along the y-axis
  * `c`: Length of the ellisoid semi-axis along the z-axis
  * `point`: Body-fixed coordinates of a point on the ellipsoid

### Output

Return the outward pointing unit normal to ellipsoid at point
