```

A dynamical system generated by an arbitrary "model" that can be stepped *in-place* with some function `step!(model)` for 1 step. The state of the model is extracted by the `extract_state(model) -> u` function The parameters of the model are extracted by the `extract_parameters(model) -> p` function. The system may be re-initialized, via [`reinit!`](@ref), with the `reset_model!` user-provided function that must have the call signature

```julia
reset_model!(model, u, p)
```

given a (potentially new) state `u` and parameter container `p`, both of which will default to the initial ones in the [`reinit!`](@ref) call.

`ArbitrarySteppable` exists to provide the DynamicalSystems.jl interface to models from other packages that could be used within the DynamicalSystems.jl library. `ArbitrarySteppable` follows the [`DynamicalSystem`](@ref) interface with the following adjustments:

  * [`initial_time`](@ref) is always 0, as time counts the steps the model has taken since creation or last [`reinit!`](@ref) call.
  * [`set_state!`](@ref) is the same as [`reinit!`](@ref) by default. If not, the keyword argument `set_state` is a function `set_state(model, u)` that sets the state of the model to `u`.
  * The keyword `isdeterministic` should be set properly, as it decides whether downstream algorithms should error or not.
