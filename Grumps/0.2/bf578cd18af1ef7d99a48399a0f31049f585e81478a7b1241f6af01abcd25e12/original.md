```
VarξHomoskedastic()
```

Creates a variable of type VarξHomoskedastic.  This is used to indicate that standard errors should be computed under the assumption of homoskedasticity.  This choice does not affect efficiency.  It also products an estimate of the matrix V(ξ) as part of the solution object, which can be used as an input into a possible second stage.
