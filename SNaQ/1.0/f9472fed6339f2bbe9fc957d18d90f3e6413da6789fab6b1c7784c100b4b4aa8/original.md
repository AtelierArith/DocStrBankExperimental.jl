```
readsnaqnetwork(output file)
```

Read the estimated network from a `.out` file generated by [`snaq!`](@ref). The network score is read also, and stored in the network's field `.loglik`.

Warning: despite the name "loglik", this score is only proportional to the network's pseudo-deviance: the lower, the better. Do NOT use this score to calculate an AIC or BIC (etc.) value.
