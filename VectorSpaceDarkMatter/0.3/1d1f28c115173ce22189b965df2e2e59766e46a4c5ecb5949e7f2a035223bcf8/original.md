ModelDMSM(a, b, mX, mSM, deltaE)
```

Stores the relevant model parameters.

`a` : Two times the power of $q$ in the dark matter form factor,           $F_{DM} \sim (q / \alpha m_e)^{a/2}$

`b` : Two times the power of $v$ in the dark matter form factor,           $F_{DM} \sim v^{b/2}$

`mX` : dark matter mass in eV

`mSM` : mass of target particle in eV

`deltaE` : discrete final state energy in eV
