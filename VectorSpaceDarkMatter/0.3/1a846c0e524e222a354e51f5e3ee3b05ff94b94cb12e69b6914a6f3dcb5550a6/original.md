ModelDMSM(fdm_n, mX, mSM, deltaE)
```

Stores the relevant model parameters. Can be called with just `fdm_n` to correspond with typically-used dark matter form factors.

`fdm_n` : The power $n$ of $1/q$ in the dark matter form factor,           $F_{DM} \sim (\alpha m_e / q)^{n}$

`mX` : dark matter mass in eV

`mSM` : mass of target particle in eV

`deltaE` : discrete final state energy in eV
