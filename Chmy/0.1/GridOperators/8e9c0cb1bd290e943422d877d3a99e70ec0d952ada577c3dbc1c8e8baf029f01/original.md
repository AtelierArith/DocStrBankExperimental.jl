```
lapl(F, grid, I...)
```

Compute the Laplacian of a field `F` on a structured grid `grid`. This operation is performed along all dimensions of the grid.

## Arguments

  * `F`: The field whose Laplacian is to be computed.
  * `grid`: The structured grid on which the operation is performed.
  * `I...`: The indices specifying the location on the grid.
