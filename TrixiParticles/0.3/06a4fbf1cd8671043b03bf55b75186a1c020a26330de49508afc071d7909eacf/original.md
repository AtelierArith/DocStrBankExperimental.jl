```
VoxelSphere()
```

Construct a sphere of voxels (where particles are placed in the voxel center) with a regular inner structure but corners on the surface. Essentially, a grid of particles is generated and all particles outside the sphere are removed. The resulting sphere will have a perfect inner structure, but is not perfectly round, as it will have corners (like a sphere in Minecraft).

!!! note "Usage"
    See [`SphereShape`](@ref) on how to use this.
