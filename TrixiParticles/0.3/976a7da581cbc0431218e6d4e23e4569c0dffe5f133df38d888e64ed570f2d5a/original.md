ParticleShiftingCallback()
```

Callback to apply the Particle Shifting Technique by [Sun et al. (2017)](@cite Sun2017). Following the original paper, the callback is applied in every time step and not in every stage of a multi-stage time integration method to reduce the computational cost and improve the stability of the scheme.
