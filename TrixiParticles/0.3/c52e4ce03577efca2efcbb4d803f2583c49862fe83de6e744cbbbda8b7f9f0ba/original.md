SurfaceTensionAkinci(surface_tension_coefficient=1.0)
```

Implements a model for surface tension and adhesion effects drawing upon the principles outlined by Akinci [Akinci2013](@cite). This model is instrumental in capturing the nuanced behaviors of fluid surfaces, such as droplet formation and the dynamics of merging or separation, by utilizing intra-particle forces.

See [`surface_tension`](@ref) for more details.
