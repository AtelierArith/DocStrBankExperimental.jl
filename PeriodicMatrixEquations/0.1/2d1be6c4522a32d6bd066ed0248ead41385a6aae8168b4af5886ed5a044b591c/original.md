```
pdlyap(A, C; adj = true, stability_check = false) -> X
```

Solve the periodic discrete-time Lyapunov equation

```
A'ﾏスA + C = X  for adj = true
```

or 

```
AXA' + C = ﾏス  for adj = false,
```

where `ﾏチ is the forward shift operator `ﾏス(i) = X(i+1)`. 

The periodic matrices `A` and `C` must have the same type, the same dimensions and commensurate periods,  and additionally `C` must be symmetric. The resulting symmetric periodic solution `X` has the period  set to the least common commensurate period of `A` and `C` and the number of subperiods is adjusted accordingly. 

If `stability_check = true`, the stability of characteristic multipliers of `A` is checked and an error is issued if any characteristic multiplier has modulus equal to or larger than one. 

The periodic discrete analog of the Bartels-Stewart method based on the periodic Schur form of the periodic matrix `A` is employed [1].
