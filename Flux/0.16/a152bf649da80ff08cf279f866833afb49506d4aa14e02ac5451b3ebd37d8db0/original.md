```
SkipConnection(layer, connection)
```

Create a skip connection which consists of a layer or `Chain` of consecutive layers and a shortcut connection linking the block's input to the output through a user-supplied 2-argument callable. The first argument to the callable will be propagated through the given `layer` while the second is the unchanged, "skipped" input.

The simplest "ResNet"-type connection is just `SkipConnection(layer, +)`. Here is a more complicated example:

```jldoctest
julia> m = Conv((3,3), 4 => 7, pad=(1,1));

julia> x = ones(Float32, 5, 5, 4, 10);

julia> size(m(x)) == (5, 5, 7, 10)
true

julia> sm = SkipConnection(m, (mx, x) -> cat(mx, x, dims=3));

julia> size(sm(x)) == (5, 5, 11, 10)
true
```
