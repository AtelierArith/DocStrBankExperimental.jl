SkewSymmetricMatrixShape
```

Shape object for a skew symmetric square matrix of `side_dimension` rows and columns. The vectorized form contains the entries of the upper-right triangular part of the matrix (without the diagonal) given column by column (or equivalently, the entries of the lower-left triangular part given row by row). The diagonal is zero.
