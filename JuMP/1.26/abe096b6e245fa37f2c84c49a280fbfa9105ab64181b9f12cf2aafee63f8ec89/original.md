```
primal_feasibility_report(
    model::GenericModel{T},
    point::AbstractDict{GenericVariableRef{T},T} = _last_primal_solution(model),
    atol::T = zero(T),
    skip_missing::Bool = false,
)::Dict{Any,T}
```

Given a dictionary `point`, which maps variables to primal values, return a dictionary whose keys are the constraints with an infeasibility greater than the supplied tolerance `atol`. The value corresponding to each key is the respective infeasibility. Infeasibility is defined as the distance between the primal value of the constraint (see `MOI.ConstraintPrimal`) and the nearest point by Euclidean distance in the corresponding set.

## Notes

  * If `skip_missing = true`, constraints containing variables that are not in `point` will be ignored.
  * If `skip_missing = false` and a partial primal solution is provided, an error will be thrown.
  * If no point is provided, the primal solution from the last time the model was solved is used.

## Example

```jldoctest
julia> model = Model();

julia> @variable(model, 0.5 <= x <= 1);

julia> primal_feasibility_report(model, Dict(x => 0.2))
Dict{Any, Float64} with 1 entry:
  x â‰¥ 0.5 => 0.3
```
