xkb_rule_names
```

Names to compile a keymap with, also known as RMLVO.

The names are the common configuration values by which a user picks a keymap.

If the entire struct is NULL, then each field is taken to be NULL. You should prefer passing NULL instead of choosing your own defaults.

| Field   | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| rules   | The rules file to use. The rules file describes how to interpret the values of the model, layout, variant and options fields.  If NULL or the empty string "", a default value is used. If the XKB_DEFAULT_RULES environment variable is set, it is used as the default. Otherwise the system default is used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| model   | The keyboard model by which to interpret keycodes and LEDs.  If NULL or the empty string "", a default value is used. If the XKB_DEFAULT_MODEL environment variable is set, it is used as the default. Otherwise the system default is used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| layout  | A comma separated list of layouts (languages) to include in the keymap.  If NULL or the empty string "", a default value is used. If the XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT environment variable is set, it is used as the default. Otherwise the system default is used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| variant | A comma separated list of variants, one per layout, which may modify or augment the respective layout in various ways.  Generally, should either be empty or have the same number of values as the number of layouts. You may use empty values as in "intl,,neo".  If NULL or the empty string "", and a default value is also used for the layout, a default value is used. Otherwise no variant is used. If the XKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT environment variable is set, it is used as the default. Otherwise the system default is used. |
| options | A comma separated list of options, through which the user specifies non-layout related preferences, like which key combinations are used for switching layouts, or which key is the Compose key.  If NULL, a default value is used. If the empty string "", no options are used. If the XKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS environment variable is set, it is used as the default. Otherwise the system default is used.                                                                                                                           |
