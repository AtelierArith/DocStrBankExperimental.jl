```
union_product(C1, C2)
```

Compute the union product of codes `C1` and `C2`, under the GrRevLex ordering on both codes.

For $A = \{a_1,...,a_m\}$ a code on $[d]$ and $B = \{b_1,...,b_d\}$ a code on $[n]$, the union product is a code on $[n]$ defined by $A ∨ B = \{ ⋃_{j ∈ a_i} b_j : a_i ∈ A\}$

More simply, this is the code obtained from the nonzero entries of the product of the matrix forms of $A$ and $B$.
