A triangulation of the Poincare homology 3-sphere (16 vertices, 90 facets)

This is a manifold whose integral homology is identical to the ordinary 3-sphere, but it is not simply connected. In particular, its fundamental group is the binary icosahedral group, which has order 120. The triangulation given here has 16 vertices and is due to Björner and Lutz [BL2000].
