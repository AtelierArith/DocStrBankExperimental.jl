The following type encodes a filtration of Z2 chain complexes.     We are going to use this to compute the homology over Z2.     Also, note that the conventions are a bit different here then in the GradedPoset type:     * We do *not* want to have a cell of dimension (-1) here, so the dimensions are all non-negative numbers.     * The elements of the posets are ordered *first* by weight and within the same weight by the dimension.       In particular, higher-dimensional element may apear earlier if it's weigth is smaller.     * the convention of how boundaries are reffered to is different from that in the GradedPoset type..
