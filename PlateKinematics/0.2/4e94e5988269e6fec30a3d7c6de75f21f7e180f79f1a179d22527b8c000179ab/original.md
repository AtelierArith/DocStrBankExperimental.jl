Main module for `PlateKinematics.jl` – a compilation of tools for easy handling of Plate Kinematics functions with Julia 🌏 📐.

This package provides types, functions and documentation for working with Finite Rotations, Euler Vectors and Surface Velocities. 
The knowledge builds from the framework layed down by Allan Cox in his book Plate Tectonics: How It Works.
