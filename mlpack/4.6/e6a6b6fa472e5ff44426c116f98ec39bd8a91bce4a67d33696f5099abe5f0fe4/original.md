mlpack

mlpack is a fast, flexible machine learning library, written in C++, that aims to provide fast, extensible implementations of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms.  This module provides those implementations as Julia functions.

Each function inside the module performs a specific machine learning task.

For complete documentation of these functions, including example usage, see the mlpack website's documentation for the Julia bindings:

https://www.mlpack.org/doc/user/bindings/julia.html

Each function also contains an equivalent docstring; the Julia REPL's help functionality can be used to access the documentation that way.
