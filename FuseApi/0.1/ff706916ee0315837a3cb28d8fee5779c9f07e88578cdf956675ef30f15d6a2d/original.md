FuseCmdlineArgs <: Layout
```

Layout template for commandline arguments as to be passed to fuse*parse*cmdline

The length of vector pointed to by `argv` is stored in field `argc`. Field `allocated` must be set to `0`, if the data is Julia generated.

If generated by Julia, use `CStructGuarded{FuseCmdlineArgs}`.
