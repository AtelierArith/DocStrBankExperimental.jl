```
get_date([date, old=true, timetag=true]) -> string
```

### Purpose

Returns the UTC date in `"CCYY-MM-DD"` format for FITS headers.

### Explanation

This is the format required by the `DATE` and `DATE-OBS` keywords in a FITS header.

### Argument

  * `date` (optional): the date in UTC standard.  If omitted, defaults to the current UTC time.  Each element can be either a `DateTime` type or anything that can be converted to that type.  In the case of vectorial input, each element is considered as a date, so you cannot provide a date by parts.
  * `old` (optional boolean keyword): see below.
  * `timetag` (optional boolean keyword): see below.

### Output

A string with the date formatted according to the given optional keywords.

  * When no optional keywords (`timetag` and `old`) are supplied, the format of the output string is `"CCYY-MM-DD"` (year-month-day part of the date), where `CCYY` represents a 4-digit calendar year, `MM` the 2-digit ordinal number of a calendar month within the calendar year, and `DD` the 2-digit ordinal number of a day within the calendar month.
  * If the boolean keyword `old` is true (default: false), the year-month-day part of date has `"DD/MM/YY"` format.  This is the formerly (pre-1997) recommended for FITS.  Note that this format is now deprecated because it uses only a 2-digit representation of the year.
  * If the boolean keyword `timetag` is true (default: false), `"Thh:mm:ss"` is appended to the year-month-day part of the date, where <hh> represents the hour in the day, <mm> the minutes, <ss> the seconds, and the literal 'T' the ISO 8601 time designator.

Note that `old` and `timetag` keywords can be used together, so that the output string will have `"DD/MM/YYThh:mm:ss"` format.

### Example

```jldoctest
julia> using AstroLib, Dates

julia> get_date(DateTime(21937, 05, 30, 09, 59, 00), timetag=true)
"21937-05-30T09:59:00"
```

### Notes

1. A discussion of the DATExxx syntax in FITS headers can be found in http://www.cv.nrao.edu/fits/documents/standards/year2000.txt
2. Those who wish to use need further flexibility in their date formats (e.g. to use TAI time) should look at Bill Thompson's time routines in http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/solarsoft/gen/idl/time
