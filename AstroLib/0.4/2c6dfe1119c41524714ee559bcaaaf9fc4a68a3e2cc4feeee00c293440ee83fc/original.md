```
tic_one(zmin, pixx, incr[, ra=true]) -> min2, tic1
```

### Purpose

Determine the position of the first tic mark for astronomical images.

### Explanation

For use in labelling images with right ascension and declination axes. This routine determines the position in pixels of the first tic.

### Arguments

  * `zmin`: astronomical coordinate value at axis zero point (degrees  or hours).
  * `pixx`: distance in pixels between tic marks (usually obtained from [`tics`](@ref)).
  * `incr` - increment in minutes for labels (usually an even number obtained  from the procedure [`tics`](@ref)).
  * `ra` (optional boolean keyword): if true, incremental value being entered  is in minutes of time, else it is assumed that value is in else it's in minutes of arc.  Default is false.

### Output

The 2 tuple `(min2, tic1)`:

  * `min2`: astronomical coordinate value at first tic mark
  * `tic1`: position in pixels of first tic mark

### Example

Suppose a declination axis has a value of 30.2345 degrees at its zero point.  A tic mark is desired every 10 arc minutes, which corresponds to 12.74 pixels, with increment for labels being 10 minutes. Then

```jldoctest
julia> using AstroLib

julia> tic_one(30.2345, 12.74, 10)
(30.333333333333332, 7.554820000000081)
```

yields values of min2 ≈ 30.333 and tic1 ≈ 7.55482, i.e. the first tic mark should be labeled 30 deg 20 minutes and be placed at pixel value 7.55482.

### Notes

Code of this function is based on IDL Astronomy User's Library.
