```
jdcnv(date) -> julian_days
```

### Purpose

Convert proleptic Gregorian Calendar date in UTC standard to number of Julian days.

### Explanation

Takes the given proleptic Gregorian date in UTC standard and returns the number of Julian calendar days since epoch `-4713-11-24T12:00:00`.

### Argument

  * `date`: date in proleptic Gregorian Calendar.  Each element can be either a `DateTime` or anything that can be converted directly to `DateTime`.

### Output

Number of Julian days, as a floating point.

### Example

Find the Julian days number at 2016 August 23, 03:39:06.

```jldoctest
julia> using AstroLib, Dates

julia> jdcnv(DateTime(2016, 08, 23, 03, 39, 06))
2.4576236521527776e6

julia> jdcnv(2016, 08, 23, 03, 39, 06)
2.4576236521527776e6

julia> jdcnv("2016-08-23T03:39:06")
2.4576236521527776e6
```

### Notes

This is the inverse of `daycnv`.

`get_juldate` returns the number of Julian days for current time.  It is equivalent to `jdcnv(now(Dates.UTC))`.

For the conversion of Julian date to number of Julian days, use `juldate`.
