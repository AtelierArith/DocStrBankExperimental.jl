`stopwords` is a lazy dictionary of stop words for multiple languages.  You can access the stop words for a given language using the language's name or ISO 639 code. For example, to get the stop words for English, you can use `stopwords["eng"]`, `stopwords["en"]`, or `stopwords["English"]`. And to get the stop words for multiple languages, you can use a list, e.g. `stopwords[["en", "fr"]]`.
