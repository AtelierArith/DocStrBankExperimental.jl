```
right_env(TM::AbstractLinearMap) -> AbstractTensorMap
```

Calculate the right environment tensor (œÅr) of a transfer matrix by finding the  dominant right eigenvector of the transfer operator.

# Arguments

  * `TM`: Abstract linear map representing the transfer matrix

# Returns

  * Right environment tensor (fixed point of right transfer operation)
