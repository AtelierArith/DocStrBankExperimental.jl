```
left_env(TM::AbstractLinearMap) -> AbstractTensorMap
```

Calculate the left environment tensor (œÅl) of a transfer matrix by finding the  dominant left eigenvector of the transfer operator.

# Arguments

  * `TM`: Abstract linear map representing the transfer matrix

# Returns

  * Left environment tensor (fixed point of left transfer operation)
