Compute the angular velocity of orbital precession.

This is the angular velocity *of* the orbital angular velocity direction unit vector $ℓ̂$; the time derivative of that *unit* vector is $Ω⃗ₚ × ℓ̂$.

At the moment, this is computed solely by expressions from [Bohé et al. (2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5520).  See [`𝛡`](@ref) for details.

See also [`R`](@ref PostNewtonian.R).
