Compute the "BKL" approximation for the ISCO (Innermost Stable Circular Orbit) frequency.

This is taken from Eq. (5) of [Hanna et al. (2008)](https://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4297).  Note that this does not account for the spins of the objects in the binary, so that this returns a very crude estimate of a frequency of interest.
