Compute the post-Newtonian parameter

$$
\gamma_{\mathrm{PN}} \equiv \frac{G\, M}{r\, c^2},
$$

where $r$ is the magnitude of the orbital separation.  This quantity has PN order 1, and is given by Eq. (4.3) of [Bohé et al. (2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5520) and Eq. (3.32) of [Bohé et al.  (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01529).

Note that there is a 3PN gauge term of $-22ν\ln(r/r₀')/3$ that is simply ignored here, as it should cancel out of any physical quantity.
