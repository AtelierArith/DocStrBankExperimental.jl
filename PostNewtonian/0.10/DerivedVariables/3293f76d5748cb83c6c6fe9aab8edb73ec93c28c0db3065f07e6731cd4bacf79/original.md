ϕ̇̂₂(s)
```

Rate of rotation of black hole 1 about the spin of black hole 2, relative to orbital rotation rate.

This is the rotation rate ϕ̇ as defined in Eq. (19) of [Alvi (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.64.104020), divided by $v^3  = M\, \Omega$.  This division is done to make sure we can track the relative PN order of terms that depend on this.

See the documentation section on ["Horizons"](@ref Horizons) for more details.
