Effective tidal deformability of the system.

Much as the chirp mass is a particularly measurable combination of the masses of the two components of the binary, this quantity is a particularly measurable combination of the tidal couplings $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ of the two components.

[Raithel et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/aabcbf) define this as

$$
\tilde{\Lambda} = \frac{16}{13}
    \frac{(M_1 + 12 M_2) M_1^4 \Lambda_1 + (M_2 + 12 M_1) M_2^4 \Lambda_2} {M^5}.
$$
