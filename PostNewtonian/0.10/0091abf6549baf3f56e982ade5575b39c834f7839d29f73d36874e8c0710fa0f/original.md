NSNS{T, PNOrder}
```

The [`PNSystem`](@ref) subtype describing a neutron-star—neutron-star binary system.

The `state` vector is the same as for a [`BBH`](@ref).  There are two additional fields `Λ₁` and `Λ₂` holding the (constant) tidal-coupling parameters of the neutron stars.  See also [`BHNS`](@ref).
