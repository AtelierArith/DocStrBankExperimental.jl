An `Atom` is a particle in the current [`Frame`](@ref).

An atom stores the following atomic properties:

  * atom name
  * atom type
  * atom mass
  * atom charge

The atom name is usually an unique identifier (`"H1"`, `"C_a"`) while the atom type will be shared among all particles of the same type: `"H"`, `"Ow"`, `"CH3"`.
