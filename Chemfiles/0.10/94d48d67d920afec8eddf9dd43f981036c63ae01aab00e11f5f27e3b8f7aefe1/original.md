A `Trajectory` represents a simulation file on the hard drive. It can read or write one or many [`Frame`](@ref)s to this file. The file format can be automatically determined from the extention, or manually specified. Writing to a `Trajectory` is buffered, which means that one needs to `close()` the trajectory and flush the buffer before being able to read the file again.
