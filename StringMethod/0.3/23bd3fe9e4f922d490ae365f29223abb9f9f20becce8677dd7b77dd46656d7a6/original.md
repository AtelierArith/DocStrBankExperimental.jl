`ClimbingImage(∇V, τ, ∇V_climb,integrate!, dist, Δt)` - Set up the Climbing Image Method

### Fields

  * `∇V`   - In place gradient of the potential
  * `τ` - Approximate tangent vector of the unstable direction
  * `∇V_climb`- In place gradient of the potential with reflector
  * `integrate!` - In place integrator
  * `Δt`    - Time step
