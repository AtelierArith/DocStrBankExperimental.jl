```
NonSimpleNumField{T}
```

Common, abstract, overtype for all number fields that are (by type) generated by more than one generator. `T` is the type of the elements of the coefficient field. Typical example is a bi-quadratic field:     QQ[sqrt 2, sqrt 3] It can be converted to a simple extension (with maps), see e.g. `absolute_simple_field` or `simple_extension`.
