```
+(T::TorQuadModule, U::TorQuadModule) -> TorQuadModule
```

Given two torsion quadratic modules `T` and `U` whose covers are in the same ambient space, return their sum `S` defined as the quotient of the sum of their covers by the sum of their respective relation lattices.

Note that `T` and `U` must have the same moduli, both bilinear and quadratic ones.
