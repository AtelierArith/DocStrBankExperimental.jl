```
matrix_algebra(R::Ring, S::NCRing, gens::Vector{<: MatElem};
               isbasis::Bool = false)
  -> MatAlgebra
```

Returns the matrix algebra over $S$ generated by the matrices in `gens` as an algebra with base ring $R$. It is assumed $S$ is an algebra over $R$. If `isbasis` is `true`, it is assumed that the given matrices are an $R$-basis of this algebra, i. e. that the spanned $R$-module is closed under multiplication.
