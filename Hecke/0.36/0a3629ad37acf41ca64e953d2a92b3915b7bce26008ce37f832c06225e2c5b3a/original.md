```
cyclotomic_field_as_cm_extension(n::Int; cached::Bool = true)
				                  -> RelSimpleNumField, RelSimpleNumFieldElem
```

Given an integer `n`, return the `n`-th cyclotomic field $E = \mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)$ seen as a quadratic extension of its maximal real subfield `K` generated by $\zeta_n+zeta_n^{-1}$.

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> E, b = cyclotomic_field_as_cm_extension(6)
(Relative number field of degree 2 over maximal real subfield of cyclotomic field of order 6, z_6)

julia> base_field(E)
Number field with defining polynomial $ - 1
  over rational field

```
