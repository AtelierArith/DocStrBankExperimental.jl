```
automorphous_numbers(g::ZZLocalGenus) -> Vector{ZZRingElem}
```

Return generators of the group of automorphous square classes at this prime.

A `p`-adic square class `r` is called automorphous if it is the spinor norm of a proper `p`-adic integral automorphism of this form. See [CS99](@cite) Chapter 15, 9.6 for details.
