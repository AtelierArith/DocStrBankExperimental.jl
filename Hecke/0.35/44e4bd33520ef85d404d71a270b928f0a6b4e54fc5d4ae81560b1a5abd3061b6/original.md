```
direct_sum(g1::HermLocalGenus, g2::HermLocalGenus) -> HermLocalGenus
```

Given two local genus symbols `g1` and `g2` for hermitian lattices over $E/K$ at the same prime ideal $\mathfrak p$ of $\mathcal O_K$, return their direct sum. It corresponds to the local genus symbol of the $\mathfrak p$-adic completion of the direct sum of respective representatives of `g1` and `g2`.
