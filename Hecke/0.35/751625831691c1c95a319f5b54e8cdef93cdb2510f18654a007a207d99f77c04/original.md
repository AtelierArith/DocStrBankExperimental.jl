```
cyclotomic_regulator(n::Int, prec::Int; maximal_totally_real::Bool = false)
```

Determine the regulator of the cyclotomic units of the cyclotomic field of conductor `n` with precision `prec`.

If `maximal_totally_real` is set to `true`, the regulator of the cyclotomic units in the maximal totally real subfield is computed.
