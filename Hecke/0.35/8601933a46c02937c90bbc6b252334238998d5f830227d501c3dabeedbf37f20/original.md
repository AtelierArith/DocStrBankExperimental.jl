```
represents(g1::ZZLocalGenus, g2::ZZLocalGenus) -> Bool
```

Return whether `g1` represents `g2`.

Based on O'Meara Integral Representations of Quadratic Forms Over Local Fields Note that for `p == 2` there is a typo in O'Meara Theorem 3 (V). The correct statement is (V) $2^i(1+4\omega) \to \mathfrak{L}_{i+1}/\mathfrak{l}_{[i]}$.
