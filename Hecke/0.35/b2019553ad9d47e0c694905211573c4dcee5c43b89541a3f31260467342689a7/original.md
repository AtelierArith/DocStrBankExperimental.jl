```
matrix_algebra(R::Ring, gens::Vector{<: MatElem}; isbasis::Bool = false)
  -> MatAlgebra
```

Returns the matrix algebra over $R$ generated by the matrices in `gens`. If `isbasis` is `true`, it is assumed that the given matrices are an $R$-basis of this algebra, i. e. that the spanned $R$-module is closed under multiplication.
