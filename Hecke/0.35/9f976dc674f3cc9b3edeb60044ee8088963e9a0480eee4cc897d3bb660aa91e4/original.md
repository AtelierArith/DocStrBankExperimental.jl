```
rescale(g::HermLocalGenus, a::Union{FieldElem, RationalUnion})
                                                          -> HermLocalGenus
```

Given a local genus symbol `G` of hermitian lattices and an element `a` lying in the base field `E` of `g`, return the local genus symbol at the prime ideal `p` associated to `g` of any representative of `g` rescaled by `a`.
