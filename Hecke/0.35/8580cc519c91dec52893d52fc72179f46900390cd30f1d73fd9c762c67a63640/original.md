```
absolute_discriminant(L::SimpleNumField, QQ) -> QQFieldElem
```

The absolute discriminant of the defining polynomial of $L$, *not* the discriminant of the maximal order of $L$. This is the norm of the discriminant times the $d$-th power of the discriminant of the base field, where $d$ is the degree of $L$.
