```
==(g1::HermLocalGenus, g2::HermLocalGenus) -> Bool
```

Given two local genus symbols `g1` and `g2`, return whether their respective Jordan decompositions are of the same Jordan type. Note that equality requires `g1` and `g2` to be defined over the same extension $E/K$ and at the same prime ideal $\mathfrak p$ of $\mathcal O_K$.
