```
Nilp(nbOne::Ti, diag::Ti, size::Ti) where{Ti <: Integer}
```

パラメータ `nbOne`、`diag`、`size` を持つニルポテント行列オブジェクトを作成します。`size` は生成されるニルポテント行列のサイズを指し、`nbOne` は生成されるニルポテント行列の非ゼロ対角線上の連続する `1` の最大数を指します。非ゼロ対角線のオフセットはパラメータ `diag` によって決まります。

非ゼロ対角線は次のように生成されます：

1. `[1, nbOne]` の範囲で整数をランダムに生成します。
2. この数は、今回のサンプリングのための連続する `1` の数を決定します。
3. 次に、同じ範囲内で別の数を生成し、連続する `0` の数を決定します。
4. その後、新しい連続する `1` のシーケンスのために再サンプリングします。
5. ...
