```
Nilp(nbOne::Ti, size::Ti) where {Ti<:Integer}
```

パラメータ `nbOne` と `size` を持つニルポテント行列オブジェクトを作成します。`size` は生成されるニルポテント行列のサイズを指し、`nbOne` は生成されるニルポテント行列の非ゼロ対角線上の連続する `1` の数を指します。

これは SMG2S によって使用されるニルポテント行列のデフォルトタイプであり、非ゼロ対角線はオフセット `1` のものが選択されます。この対角線は `nbOne` 個の `1` から始まり、その後に `0` が続き、再び `nbOne` 個の `1` が続き、... 最後まで続きます。

## 例

```jldoctest; setup = :(using SMG2S)
julia> SMG2S.Nilp(2,8)
Nilpotent{Int64}(2, 8, 3,

  ⋅    ⋅   1.0   ⋅    ⋅    ⋅    ⋅    ⋅
  ⋅    ⋅    ⋅    ⋅    ⋅    ⋅    ⋅    ⋅
