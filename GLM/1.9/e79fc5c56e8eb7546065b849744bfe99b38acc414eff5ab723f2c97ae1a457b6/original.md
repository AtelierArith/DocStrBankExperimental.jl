The canonical [`Link`](@ref) for [`Distributions.NegativeBinomial`](https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/stable/univariate/#Distributions.NegativeBinomial) distribution, defined as `η = log(μ/(μ+θ))`. The shape parameter θ has to be fixed for the distribution to belong to the exponential family.
