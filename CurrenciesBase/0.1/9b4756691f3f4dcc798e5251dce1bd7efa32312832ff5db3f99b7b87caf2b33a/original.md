Get a brief human-readable English-language description of the currency. The description should begin with the common name of the currency, which should describe it unambiguously (up to variations on the same currency). Optionally, parentheses following the main description may include additional information (such as the unit of a major currency unit).

This function may be called with either a symbol, a `Monetary` type, or a `Monetary` object.
