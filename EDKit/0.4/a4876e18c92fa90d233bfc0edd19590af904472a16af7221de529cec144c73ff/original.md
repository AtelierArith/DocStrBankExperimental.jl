TranslationalBasis
```

Basis for subspace that is spanned by momentum states, which can also incorporate projected restriction. For each basis vector represented by `dgt`, the vector is     |aₙ⟩ = ∑ᵢ Tⁱ |dgt⟩. The normalized basis is     |n⟩ = Rₙ⁻¹ |aₙ⟩, where Rₙ is the normalization.

## Properties:

  * `dgt`: Digits.
  * `I`  : List of indicies.
  * `R`  : List of normalization.
  * `C`  : Unit phase factor.
  * `B`  : Base.
