```
markov_ts(t_matrix, start_arr, trials=1)
```

*markov_ts* is a time-series method that allows you to see the transition states trial by trial. Extremely useful for market share or account receivables problems where you want to see the states change over time.

*t_matrix* is the transition Matrix *start_arr* is the starting values for the chain.  *trials* is the number of iterations you want to run through the Markov Chain Process.
