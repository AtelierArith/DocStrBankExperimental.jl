Experience learning curve method.

```
    struct ExperienceMethod <: LearningCurveMethod end
```

Popularized by Bruce Henderson of the Boston Consulting Group in the 1970s, the experience  curve expands on Wrightâ€™s observation to encompass total cost reductions (including overhead and other  factors) as cumulative production increases. It suggests that as cumulative output doubles, total costs fall by a constant percentage, reflecting economies of scale and learning effects throughout an organization.  

$\text{Cost} = \text{InitialEffort} \times (\text{TotalUnits}^{\text{Learning}})$

**When to Use:**  

  * For strategic analysis and competitive planning when broad organizational efficiency improvements  are observed.  

    **When to Avoid:**
  * When cost behavior is highly non-linear or when improvements are due to sudden technological breakthroughs.
