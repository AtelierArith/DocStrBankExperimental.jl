Estimate the learning rate using Wright's method from two production data points. 

```
learn_rate(::WrightMethod, TotalUnitsA, WorkUnitA, TotalUnitsB, WorkUnitB)
```

This method can be used as a starting point for the Crawford and Experience curves because no closed form solutions exist for these methods
