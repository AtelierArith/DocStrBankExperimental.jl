```
α,α⁺ = positiveP(state <: State,N)
```

Generate `N` samples from the positive-P (+P) phase-space distribution for `state`.

Moments of the +P distribution generate quantum operator averages that are normally ordered.

In general the two random variates α,α⁺ are statistically independent for the +P distribution.
