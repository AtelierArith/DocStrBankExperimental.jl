PSDH4(I₁, I₂, I₃, I₄)
```

return object wave extracted by the four-step phase-shifting method. See (Creath, 1988), (Schreiber and Bruning, 2006). Phase difference `δ` corresponding to `I₁`, `I₂`, `I₃`, and `I₄` are assumed to be $\delta = 0, \dfrac{\pi}{2}, \pi$, and $\dfrac{3\pi}{2}$, respectively.
