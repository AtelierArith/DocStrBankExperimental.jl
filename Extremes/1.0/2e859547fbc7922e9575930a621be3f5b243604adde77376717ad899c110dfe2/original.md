Estimate the Gumbel parameters with the probability weighted moments.

# Implementation

Estimation with the probability weighted moments, as described by [Landwehr *et al. (1979)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR015i005p01055), is only possible in the stationary case.

See also [`gumbelfitpwm`](@ref) for the other methods, [`gevfit`](@ref), [`gevfitbayes`](@ref) and [`BlockMaxima`](@ref).
