aic(fm:::MaximumLikelihoodAbstractExtremeValueModel)
```

Compute the Akaike information criterion (AIC) of the fitted model by maximum likelihood method.

## Details

The AIC is defined as follows:

$AIC = 2 k - 2 \log \hat{L};$

where $k$ is the number of estimated parameters and $\hat{L}$ is the maximized value of the likelihood function for the model.
