Simple k-vectors formed from the wedge product starting with orthogonal 1-vector basis. Simple bivectors, trivectors, etc.

Types for blades are generated as a unique type for each different k-vector with acending indices i.e. e₁, e₂, e₁₂

Equipped with a metric such that eᵢ⋅eᵢ = {1,-1,0} depending on if the metric is +,-, or 0

product of parallel basis eᵢ*eⱼ == eᵢ⋅eⱼ when i=j 

product of orthogonal basis eᵢ*eⱼ == eᵢ∧eⱼ == -eⱼ*eᵢ when i≠j 

operators:

  * geometric product

∧ wedge/exterior product -+ subraction, addition between blades of same type (span the same subspace ) !,⟂ orthogonal complement ~ reverse ⋆ Hodge star
