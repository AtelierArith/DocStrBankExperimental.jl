```
Given a graph, a set of infected and a contagion_probability, this function
compute a Reed-Frost process and return a dictionary with the following informations:

 - "infected series" => the number of infected over time,
 - "total infected" => the number of total infected,
 - "% infected" => percentage of total infected,
 - "survived" => the number of total survived,
 - "% survived" => percentage of total survived,
 - "age" => the time needed to end the process,
 - "contagion probability" => the given ontagion probability,
 - "number of node" => the number of nodes of the given graph,
 - "number of edges" => the number of edges of the given graph
```
