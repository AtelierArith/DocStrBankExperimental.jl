Monotonicity <: Criterion
```

An object for the fairness criterion monotonicity. A voting system that satisfies the monotonicity criterion cannot elect  a different candidate by increasing votes (without otherwise changing the rank order) of a candidate who would otherwise win. In other words, redistributing more votes to the winner (without otherwise changing the rank order), should not prevent the winner from winning.
