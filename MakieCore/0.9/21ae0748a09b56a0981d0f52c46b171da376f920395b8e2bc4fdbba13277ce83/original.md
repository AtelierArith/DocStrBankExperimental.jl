```
heatmap(x, y, matrix)
heatmap(x, y, func)
heatmap(matrix)
heatmap(xvector, yvector, zvector)
```

Plots a heatmap as a collection of rectangles. `x` and `y` can either be of length `i` and `j` where `(i, j)` is `size(matrix)`, in this case the rectangles will be placed around these grid points like voronoi cells. Note that for irregularly spaced `x` and `y`, the points specified by them are not centered within the resulting rectangles.

`x` and `y` can also be of length `i+1` and `j+1`, in this case they are interpreted as the edges of the rectangles.

Colors of the rectangles are derived from `matrix[i, j]`. The third argument may also be a `Function` (i, j) -> v which is then evaluated over the grid spanned by `x` and `y`.

Another allowed form is using three vectors `xvector`, `yvector` and `zvector`. In this case it is assumed that no pair of elements `x` and `y` exists twice. Pairs that are missing from the resulting grid will be treated as if `zvector` had a `NaN`     element at that position.

If `x` and `y` are omitted with a matrix argument, they default to `x, y = axes(matrix)`.

Note that `heatmap` is slower to render than `image` so `image` should be preferred for large, regularly spaced grids.

## Plot type

The plot type alias for the `heatmap` function is `Heatmap`.

## Attributes

**`alpha`** =  `1.0`  — The alpha value of the colormap or color attribute. Multiple alphas like in `plot(alpha=0.2, color=(:red, 0.5)`, will get multiplied.

**`clip_planes`** =  `automatic`  — Clip planes offer a way to do clipping in 3D space. You can set a Vector of up to 8 `Plane3f` planes here, behind which plots will be clipped (i.e. become invisible). By default clip planes are inherited from the parent plot or scene. You can remove parent `clip_planes` by passing `Plane3f[]`.

**`colormap`** =  `@inherit colormap :viridis`  — Sets the colormap that is sampled for numeric `color`s. `PlotUtils.cgrad(...)`, `Makie.Reverse(any_colormap)` can be used as well, or any symbol from ColorBrewer or PlotUtils. To see all available color gradients, you can call `Makie.available_gradients()`.

**`colorrange`** =  `automatic`  — The values representing the start and end points of `colormap`.

**`colorscale`** =  `identity`  — The color transform function. Can be any function, but only works well together with `Colorbar` for `identity`, `log`, `log2`, `log10`, `sqrt`, `logit`, `Makie.pseudolog10` and `Makie.Symlog10`.

**`depth_shift`** =  `0.0`  — Adjusts the depth value of a plot after all other transformations, i.e. in clip space, where `-1 <= depth <= 1`. This only applies to GLMakie and WGLMakie and can be used to adjust render order (like a tunable overdraw).

**`fxaa`** =  `true`  — Adjusts whether the plot is rendered with fxaa (anti-aliasing, GLMakie only).

**`highclip`** =  `automatic`  — The color for any value above the colorrange.

**`inspectable`** =  `@inherit inspectable`  — Sets whether this plot should be seen by `DataInspector`. The default depends on the theme of the parent scene.

**`inspector_clear`** =  `automatic`  — Sets a callback function `(inspector, plot) -> ...` for cleaning up custom indicators in DataInspector.

**`inspector_hover`** =  `automatic`  — Sets a callback function `(inspector, plot, index) -> ...` which replaces the default `show_data` methods.

**`inspector_label`** =  `automatic`  — Sets a callback function `(plot, index, position) -> string` which replaces the default label generated by DataInspector.

**`interpolate`** =  `false`  — Sets whether colors should be interpolated

**`lowclip`** =  `automatic`  — The color for any value below the colorrange.

**`model`** =  `automatic`  — Sets a model matrix for the plot. This overrides adjustments made with `translate!`, `rotate!` and `scale!`.

**`nan_color`** =  `:transparent`  — The color for NaN values.

**`overdraw`** =  `false`  — Controls if the plot will draw over other plots. This specifically means ignoring depth checks in GL backends

**`space`** =  `:data`  — Sets the transformation space for box encompassing the plot. See `Makie.spaces()` for possible inputs.

**`ssao`** =  `false`  — Adjusts whether the plot is rendered with ssao (screen space ambient occlusion). Note that this only makes sense in 3D plots and is only applicable with `fxaa = true`.

**`transformation`** =  `:automatic`  — *No docs available.*

**`transparency`** =  `false`  — Adjusts how the plot deals with transparency. In GLMakie `transparency = true` results in using Order Independent Transparency.

**`visible`** =  `true`  — Controls whether the plot will be rendered or not.
