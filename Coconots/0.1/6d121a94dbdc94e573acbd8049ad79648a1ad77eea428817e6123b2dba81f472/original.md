cocoPredictOneStep(cocoReg_fit, x=0:10, covariates=nothing, safe_array = Array{Float64}(undef, length(x)))
```

Predicts one-step ahead count probabilities from a fitted count regression model.

# Arguments

  * `cocoReg_fit`: A dictionary containing fitted model information (e.g., data, parameters, order, type, link, etc.).
  * `x` (optional): A range or vector of possible future count values over which the prediction is computed (default is `0:10`).
  * `covariates` (optional): Optional covariate information used for prediction.
  * `safe_array` (optional): A preallocated array to store computed probabilities.

# Returns

A dictionary with:

  * `"probabilities"`: A vector of predicted probabilities for each count in `x`.
  * `"x"`: The input range of counts.
  * `"prediction_mode"`: The mode (most likely count) based on the maximum probability.
  * `"prediction_median"`: The median prediction computed from the cumulative probability.
