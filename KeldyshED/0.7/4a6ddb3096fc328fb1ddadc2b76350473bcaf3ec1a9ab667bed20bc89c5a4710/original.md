```julia
cdag_connection(
    ed::KeldyshED.EDCore,
    indices::Vector{Union{Int64, String}},
    sp_index::Int64
) -> Union{Nothing, Int64}

```

Extract a subspace-to-subspace connection generated by a creation operator from an Exact Diagonalization solver. Returns `nothing` if no such connection exists.

## Arguments

  * `ed`:       The Exact Diagonalization solver object.
  * `indices`:  Compound index of the creation operator (must be part of `ed.full_hs.soi`).
  * `sp_index`: Initial subspace index.
