```julia
monomial_connection(
    ed::KeldyshED.EDCore,
    mon::KeldyshED.Operators.Monomial
) -> BitMatrix

```

Extract a matrix of subspace-to-subspace connections generated by a monomial operator (a product of canonical operators $c$/$c^\dagger$) from an Exact Diagonalization solver. This method returns a square boolean matrix of size `length(ed.subspaces)` with `true` elements corresponding to the existing connections between the subspaces.

## Arguments

  * `ed`:  The Exact Diagonalization solver object.
  * `mon`: Monomial in question.
