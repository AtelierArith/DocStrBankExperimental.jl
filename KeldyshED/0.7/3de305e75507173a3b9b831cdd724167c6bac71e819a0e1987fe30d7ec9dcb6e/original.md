```julia
cdag_connection(
    ed::KeldyshED.EDCore,
    op_linear_index::Int64,
    sp_index::Int64
) -> Union{Nothing, Int64}

```

Extract a subspace-to-subspace connection generated by a creation operator from an Exact Diagonalization solver. Returns `nothing` if no such connection exists.

## Arguments

  * `ed`:              The Exact Diagonalization solver object.
  * `op_linear_index`: Linear index of the creation operator as defined by `ed.full_hs.soi`.
  * `sp_index`:        Initial subspace index.
