```julia
c_connection(
    ed::KeldyshED.EDCore,
    op_linear_index::Int64
) -> BitMatrix

```

Extract a matrix of subspace-to-subspace connections generated by an annihilation operator from an Exact Diagonalization solver. This method returns a square boolean matrix of size `length(ed.subspaces)` with `true` elements corresponding to the existing connections between the subspaces.

## Arguments

  * `ed`:              The Exact Diagonalization solver object.
  * `op_linear_index`: Linear index of the annihilation operator as defined by                    `ed.full_hs.soi`.
