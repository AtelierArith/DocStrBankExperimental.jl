```julia
c_connection(
    ed::KeldyshED.EDCore,
    indices::Vector{Union{Int64, String}}
) -> BitMatrix

```

Extract a matrix of subspace-to-subspace connections generated by an annihilation operator from an Exact Diagonalization solver. This method returns a square boolean matrix of size `length(ed.subspaces)` with `true` elements corresponding to the existing connections between the subspaces.

## Arguments

  * `ed`:       The Exact Diagonalization solver object.
  * `indices`:  Compound index of the annihilation operator (must be part of             `ed.full_hs.soi`).
