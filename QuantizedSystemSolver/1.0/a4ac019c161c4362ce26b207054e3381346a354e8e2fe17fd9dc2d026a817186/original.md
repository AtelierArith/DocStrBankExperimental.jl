```
addsub(a::Taylor0, b::Taylor0, c::T, cache::Taylor0) where {T<:Number}
```

Performs an addition and subtraction operation on Taylor series objects.

# Arguments

  * `a::Taylor0`: The first Taylor series object.
  * `b::Taylor0`: The second Taylor series object.
  * `c::T`: A scalar value to be subtracted from the constant term of `b`.
  * `cache::Taylor0`: A Taylor series object used as a cache to store the result.

# Returns

  * `cache::Taylor0`: The result of the operation, stored in the `cache` object.

# Description

This function performs the following operations:

1. Copies the coefficients of `b` into `cache`.
2. Subtracts the scalar `c` from the constant term of `cache`.
3. Adds the coefficients of `a` to `cache`.

The result is stored in the `cache` object and returned.
