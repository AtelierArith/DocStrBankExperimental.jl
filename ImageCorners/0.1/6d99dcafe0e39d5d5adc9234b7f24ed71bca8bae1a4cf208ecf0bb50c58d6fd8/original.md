HomogeneousPoint(x::NTuple{N, T}) In projective geometry [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates) are the natural coordinates for describing points and lines. For instance, the homogeneous coordinates for a planar point are a triplet of real numbers $(u, v ,w)$, with $w \neq 0$. This triple can be associated with a point $P = (x,y)$ in Cartesian coordinates, where $x = \frac{u}{w}$ and $y = \frac{v}{w}$ [(more details)](http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/reference/CRC-formulas/node6.html#SECTION01140000000000000000). In particular, the `HomogeneousPoint((10.0,5.0,1.0))` is the standardised projective representation of the Cartesian point `(10.0,5.0)`.
