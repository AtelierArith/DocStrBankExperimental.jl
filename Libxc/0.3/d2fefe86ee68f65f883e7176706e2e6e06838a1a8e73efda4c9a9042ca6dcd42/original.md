Evaluate a functional obtaining the energy and / or certain derivatives of it. What is returned depends on `derivatives`, which should be a range of derivative orders, e.g. `0:1` (the default) for the energy and potential, `0:0` for just the energy and so on. The required input arguments depend on the functional type (`rho` for all functionals, `sigma` for GGA and mGGA, `tau` and `lapl` for mGGA). Obtained data is returned as a named tuple.
