```
TruePositiveRate(; levels=nothing, rev=nothing, checks=true)
```

Return a callable measure for computing the true positive rate. Aliases: `true_positive_rate`, `truepositive_rate`, `tpr`, `sensitivity`, `recall`, `hit_rate`.

```
m(ŷ, y)
```

Evaluate some measure `m` returned by the `TruePositiveRate` constructor (e.g., `m = TruePositiveRate()`) on predictions `ŷ`, given ground truth observations `y`. When ordering classes (levels) on the basis of the eltype of `y`, the *second* level is the "positive" class. To reverse roles, specify `rev=true`.

Method is optimized for `CategoricalArray` inputs with `levels` inferred. In that case `levels` will be the complete internal class pool, and not just the observed levels.

`m` can also be called on a confusion matrix. See [`ConfusionMatrix`](@ref).

# Keyword options

  * `levels::Union{Vector,Nothing}=nothing`: if `nothing`, levels are inferred from  `ŷ` and `y` and, by default, ordered according to the element type of `y`.
  * `rev=false`: in the case of binary data, whether to reverse the `levels` (as inferred or specified); a `nothing` value is the same as `false`.

  * `checks=true`: when true, specified `levels` are checked to see they include all observed levels; set to `false` for speed.

Generally, an observation `obs` in `MLUtils.eachobs(y)` is expected to satisfy `ScientificTypes.scitype(obs)<:``Union{OrderedFactor{2},Missing}` (binary classification where definition of "positive" class matters).
