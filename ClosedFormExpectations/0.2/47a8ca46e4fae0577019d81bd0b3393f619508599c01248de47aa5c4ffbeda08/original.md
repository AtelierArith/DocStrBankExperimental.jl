LogGamma(α, β)

The LogGamma distribution is a continuous probability distribution on the real numbers. It is defined as:

The probability density function of the LogGamma distribution is defined as:

\mathcal{LG}(x \mid a, b) = \frac{e^{b x} e^{-e^{x}/a}}{a^{b} \Gamma(b)}, \quad -\infty < x < \infty, a > 0, b > 0.
