When temperature remains contstant but volume changes we can calculate new pressure by using Boyles law when solving for volume.  Which simlpy states : New pressure = old pressure * curent volume devided by new volume 

curentPressure = The curent pressure in mm curentVolume = The curent volume of the gas desiredVolume = The volume we want to have
