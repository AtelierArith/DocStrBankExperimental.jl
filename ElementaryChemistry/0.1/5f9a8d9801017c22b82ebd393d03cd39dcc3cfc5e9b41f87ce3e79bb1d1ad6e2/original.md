The pressure of a gas of fixed mass and fixed volume is directly  proprtional to the gas's absolute temperature.

If a gas's temperature increases, so does its pressure if the mass and volume are  held constant.

pressure = Curent pressure in atm temperature = Curent temperature of container newTemp = temperature at which we want to know the pressure temperatureUnit = (c)entigrade, (f)ahrenheit, or (a)bsolute
