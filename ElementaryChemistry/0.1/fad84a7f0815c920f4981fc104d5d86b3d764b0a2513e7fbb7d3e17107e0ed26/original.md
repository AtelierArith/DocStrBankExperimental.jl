When temperature remains contstant but pressure changes we can calculate new volume by using Boyles law when solving for pressure.  Which simlpy states : New volume = old volume * old pressure devided by new pressure 

curentPressure = The curent pressure in mm curentVolume = The curent volume of the gas desiredPressure = The pressure we want to be at
