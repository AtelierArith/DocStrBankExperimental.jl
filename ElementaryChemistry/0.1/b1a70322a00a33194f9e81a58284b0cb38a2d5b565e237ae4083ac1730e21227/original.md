Calculate the volume by using charles law, stating that gas volume increases or decreases directly relative to change in temprature. 

curentVolume = Curent c.c of gas curenttemperature = The Curent temperature in either C or F newtemperature = temperature the gas is being heated, or cooled to temperatureUnit = (c)entigrade, (f)ahrenheit, or (a)bsolute
