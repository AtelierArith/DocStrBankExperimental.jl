The [Multivariate lognormal distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution) is a multidimensional generalization of the *lognormal distribution*.

If $\boldsymbol X \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol\mu,\,\boldsymbol\Sigma)$ has a multivariate normal distribution then $\boldsymbol Y=\exp(\boldsymbol X)$ has a multivariate lognormal distribution.

Mean vector $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ of the underlying normal distribution are known as the *location* and *scale* parameters of the corresponding lognormal distribution.
