```
draw_θᵥ()
```

Draw a random angle θ that is a multiple of kπ/4, where k is an integer between 0 and 7, inclusive. This function uses the `rand_k_0_7` function to select k, and then calculates θ.

# Returns

  * A random angle θ that is a multiple of kπ/4.

# Examples

```julia
draw_θᵥ() # Outputs: A multiple of π/4 between 0 and 7π/4
```
