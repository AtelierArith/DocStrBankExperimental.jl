```
get_corrections_multi_neighbourhood_mulit_vertex_graph(resource::MBQCResourceState, vertex::Int64)
```

This function calculates the corrections needed for a multi-neighbourhood multi-vertex graph in the context of MBQC (Measurement-Based Quantum Computation).

# Arguments

  * `resource::MBQCResourceState`: The MBQC resource state.
  * `vertex::Int64`: The vertex for which the corrections are calculated.

# Returns

  * `corrections`: A tuple containing the X and Z corrections.

# Example

```julia
corrections = get_corrections_multi_neighbourhood_mulit_vertex_graph(resource, vertex) # Returns the corrections needed for the given vertex
```
