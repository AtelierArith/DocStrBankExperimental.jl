```
measure_along_ϕ_basis!(client::Client, ψ, v::Union{Int32,Int64}, ϕ::Float64)
```

This function measures a quantum state along a specific basis.  It first applies a Z rotation to the state, then applies a Hadamard gate,  and finally performs a measurement. The basis is determined by the angle ϕ.

# Arguments

  * `client::Client`: The Client object.
  * `ψ`: The quantum state to be measured.
  * `v::Union{Int32,Int64}`: The vertex on which the operations are applied.
  * `ϕ::Float64`: The angle determining the basis for measurement.

# Returns

  * The result of the measurement.

# Examples

```julia
client = Client()
ψ = QuantumState()
v = 1
ϕ = π/4
measure_along_ϕ_basis!(client, ψ, v, ϕ)
```
