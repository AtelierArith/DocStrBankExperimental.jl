```
update_ϕ!(::TestRound, ::DummyQubit, ::NoInputQubits, meta_graph, vertex)
```

Updates the ϕ value of a given vertex in the `meta_graph` during a test round with a dummy qubit and no input qubits. The new ϕ value is computed based on a randomly drawn θᵥ value.

# Arguments

  * `::TestRound`: Indicates that this function is used during a test round.
  * `::DummyQubit`: Indicates that a dummy qubit is used.
  * `::NoInputQubits`: Indicates that there are no input qubits.
  * `meta_graph`: The graph to be updated.
  * `vertex`: The vertex in the graph for which the ϕ value is to be updated.

# Returns

  * The updated `meta_graph`.

# Examples

```julia
updated_graph = update_ϕ!(TestRound(), DummyQubit(), NoInputQubits(), meta_graph, vertex) # Updates the ϕ value of the specified vertex in the graph
```
