```
run_computation(client_meta_graph, num_qubits_from_server, server_quantum_state)
```

Runs a computation by creating a new `Client` instance for each qubit from the server. The function iterates over the number of qubits from the server, updates the client's Ï•, measures along the Ï• basis on the client, updates the measurement on the client, and stores the measurement outcome on the client. The updated client meta graph is returned.

# Arguments

  * `client_meta_graph`: The client's meta graph.
  * `num_qubits_from_server`: The number of qubits from the server.
  * `server_quantum_state`: The quantum state of the server.

# Returns

  * `client_meta_graph`: The updated client meta graph.

# Examples

```julia
client_meta_graph = create_graph(Client(), 3)
num_qubits_from_server = 3
server_quantum_state = create_quantum_state(Client(), num_qubits_from_server)
updated_client_meta_graph = run_computation(client_meta_graph, num_qubits_from_server, server_quantum_state)
```
