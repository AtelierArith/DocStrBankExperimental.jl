```
compute_trap_round_fail_threshold(total_rounds, computational_rounds, number_different_test_rounds, inherent_bounded_error::InherentBoundedError)
```

Computes the threshold for trap round failures. The function first calculates the number of test rounds by subtracting the number of computational rounds from the total rounds. It then uses this number, the number of different test rounds, and the inherent bounded error to calculate the threshold, which is then floored to the nearest integer.

# Arguments

  * `total_rounds`: The total number of rounds.
  * `computational_rounds`: The number of computational rounds.
  * `number_different_test_rounds`: The number of different test rounds.
  * `inherent_bounded_error::InherentBoundedError`: An instance of `InherentBoundedError` representing the inherent bounded error.

# Returns

  * `Int`: The floored threshold for trap round failures.

# Examples

```julia
total_rounds = 10
computational_rounds = 5
number_different_test_rounds = 3
inherent_bounded_error = InherentBoundedError(0.33)
threshold = compute_trap_round_fail_threshold(total_rounds, computational_rounds, number_different_test_rounds, inherent_bounded_error)
```
