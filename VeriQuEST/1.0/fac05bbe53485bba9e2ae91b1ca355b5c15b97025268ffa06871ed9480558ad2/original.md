```
verify_round(::Client, ::TestRound, mg)
```

Verifies a round of computation from a client's meta graph. The function iterates over the vertices of the meta graph, checks if the vertex type is a `TrapQubit`, gets the neighbors and properties of the vertex, calculates the verification result, and stores the result in a list. If all results are `TrapPass`, the function returns 1 (indicating the round is good); otherwise, it returns 0 (indicating the round is bad).

# Arguments

  * `::Client`: A `Client` instance.
  * `::TestRound`: A `TestRound` instance.
  * `mg`: The client's meta graph.

# Returns

  * `Int`: 1 if the round is good, 0 if the round is bad.

# Examples

```julia
mg = create_meta_graph(Client())
round_verification = verify_round(Client(), TestRound(), mg)
```
