```
get_corrections_one_neighbourhood_mulit_vertex_graph(resource::MBQCResourceState, vertex::Int64)
```

This function calculates the corrections needed for a vertex in a multi-vertex graph with one neighbourhood. It takes the resource state `resource` and the vertex `vertex` as input.

# Arguments

  * `resource::MBQCResourceState`: The resource state of the graph.
  * `vertex::Int64`: The vertex for which corrections are calculated.

# Returns

  * `corrections::NamedTuple`: A named tuple containing the X and Z corrections for the vertex.

# Example

```julia
corrections = get_corrections_one_neighbourhood_mulit_vertex_graph(resource, vertex) # Returns the corrections needed for the given vertex
```
