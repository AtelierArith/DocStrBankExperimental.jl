```
is_round_OK(trap_results)
```

Checks if a round is successful by examining the trap results. The function filters out the trap results that are equal to 0 (indicating a failure), and checks if the length of the failed traps is less than 1. If there is at least one failed trap, the function returns `false`, indicating that the round is not OK.

# Arguments

  * `trap_results`: An array of trap results.

# Returns

  * `Bool`: `true` if the round is OK (no failed traps), `false` otherwise.

# Examples

```julia
trap_results = [1, 0, 1]
round_OK = is_round_OK(trap_results)
```
