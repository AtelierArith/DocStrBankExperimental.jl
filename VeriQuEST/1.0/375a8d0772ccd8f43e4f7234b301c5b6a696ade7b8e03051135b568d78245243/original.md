```
create_quantum_state(client::Client, density_matrix::DensityMatrix, quantum_env, num_qubits)
```

Create a quantum state using a density matrix representation.

# Arguments

  * `client::Client`: The client object representing the quantum computing service.
  * `density_matrix::DensityMatrix`: The density matrix object representing the quantum state.
  * `quantum_env`: The quantum environment object.
  * `num_qubits`: The number of qubits to be used in the quantum state.

# Returns

  * The quantum state represented as a density matrix.

# Examples

```julia
client = Client()
env = create_quantum_env(client)
state = create_quantum_state(client, DensityMatrix(), env, 2)
```
