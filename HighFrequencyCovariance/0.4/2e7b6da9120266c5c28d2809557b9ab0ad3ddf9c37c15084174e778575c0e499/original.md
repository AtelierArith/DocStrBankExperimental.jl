```
blockwise_estimation(ts::SortedDataFrame, blocking_frame::DataFrame)
```

Run a series of covariance estimations and combine the results. Two things should be input, a SortedDataFrame with the price update data and a dataframe describing what estimations should be performed. This should be of the same form as is output by `put_assets_into_blocks_by_trading_frequency` (although the actual estimations can be customised to something different as to what that function outputs).

### Inputs

  * `ts` - The tick data.
  * `blocking_frame` - A `DataFrame` representing what estimations to do and in what order. This is often be one generated by the `put_assets_into_blocks_by_trading_frequency` function (and potentially then modified).

### Returns

  * A `CovarianceMatrix`.
