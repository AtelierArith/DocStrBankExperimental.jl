`domain(basis)`

The domain of a function basis.

`domain(transformation)`

The (co)domain of a transformation. The “other” domain (codomain, depending on the mapping) is provided explicitly for transformations, and should be compatible with the`domain` of the basis.

See [`domain_kind`](@ref) for the interface supported by domains.
