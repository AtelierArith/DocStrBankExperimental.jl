Rewrite rules which are (usually) encoded as spans.  The L structure encodes a pattern to be matched.  The R morphism encodes a replacement pattern to be substituted in. They are related to each other by an interface I with maps: L ⟵ I ⟶ R 

A semantics (DPO, SPO, CoNeg, or SqPO) must be chosen.

Control the match-finding process by specifying whether the match is intended to be monic or not, as well as an optional application condition(s)
