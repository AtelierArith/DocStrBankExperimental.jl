L  ⟵ K ⟶ R  tl ↓     ↓ tk     <== tl, tk must be monic     L' ⟵ K'

It is assumed we never want the typing/adherence match to be monic, but we  can optionally restrict the match L → G to be monic.

We can attach application conditions to both the match morphism as well as the  adherence morphism. Until morphism search under constraints becomes efficient, it's sometimes needed to just directly state the adherence morphism as a  function of the match morphism.
