Check identification condition for pushout complement of finite sets.

The identification condition says that the functions do not map (1) both a deleted item and a preserved item in L to the same item in G or (2) two distinct deleted items to the same item. It is trivially satisfied for injective functions.

Returns pair of iterators of

(1) a nondeleted item that maps to a deleted item in G   (2) a pair of distinct items in L that are deleted yet mapped to the same       item in G.
