composeV_(r₁, r₂)
```

compose two rewrite rules vertically with pullbacks, as shown below:        L₁₋ₙ -> L        ↑       ↑        I₁₋ₙ -> I        ↓       ↓         L₁₋ₙ        ->   L        R₁₋ₙ -> R           ↑              ↑            ∘v      = I₁₋ₙ ×ᵣ₁₋ₙ  Θ₁₋ₙ -> I ×ᵣ Θ        Λ₁₋ₙ -> Λ           ↓              ↓        ↑       ↑         Ω₁₋ₙ        ->   Ω        Θ₁₋ₙ -> Θ        ↓       ↓        Ω₁₋ₙ -> Ω
