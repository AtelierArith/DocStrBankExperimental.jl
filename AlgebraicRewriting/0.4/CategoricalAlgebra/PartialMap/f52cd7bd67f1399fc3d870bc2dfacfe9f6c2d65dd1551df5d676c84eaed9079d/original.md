A partial function is defined by the following span:                           m   f                         A ↩ X → B

We compute ϕ(m,f): A ⟶ T(B) such that the following is a pullback square:      f   X  ⟶ B m ↓     ↓ η(B)   A  ⟶ T(B)      ϕ

Essentially, ϕ sends elements of A to the 'real' values in T(B) when A is in the subobject picked out by X. When A is 'deleted', it picks out the right element of the additional data added by T(B).
