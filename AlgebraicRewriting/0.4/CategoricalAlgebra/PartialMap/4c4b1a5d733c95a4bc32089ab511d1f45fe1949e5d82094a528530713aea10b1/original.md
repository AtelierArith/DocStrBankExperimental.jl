Because the functorial embedding of objects keeps a copy of the original data, what to do with morphisms is just carry them along. Because our implementation adds all of the additional stuff afterwards, index-wise, we can use literally the same data for a morphism lifted from X⟶Y to T(X)⟶T(Y).

However, we still need to map the extra stuff in T(X) to the proper extra stuff in T(Y).
