Lazily grown behavior tree induced by a Mealy machine. The future behavior is  dictated by the inputs seen thus far (i.e. a vector of WireVals).

Each vertex is identified by a sequence of inputs and has a state of the Mealy  machine associated with it.

Each nonempty sequence of inputs has a MealyRes associated with it.
