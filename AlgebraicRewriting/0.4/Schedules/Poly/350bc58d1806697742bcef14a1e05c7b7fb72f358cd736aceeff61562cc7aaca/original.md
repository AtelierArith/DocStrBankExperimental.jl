In theory applying a schedule should result in a list of ACSets associated with  out ports and monad labels (e.g. probabilities), and if one were to want to  recover the trajectory of the output one would have to use a Writer monad  of some sort. For simplicity, the application of a schedule will simply return  the trajectories themselves (monadic multiplication could in principle condense  this output to the pure output).
