Mealy machines (augmented with monadic output) are a user-friendly format for specifying a behavior tree. Behavior trees in general are not finitely  expressible, but we focus on trees which can be lazily generated by functions.

Although it is conceptually simple to think of a single set of "input doors" out  "output doors" to enter/leave the Mealy machine, such that a Mealy machine has  type A → B, we use Σᵢ Aᵢ → Σⱼ Bⱼ, where Aᵢ and Bⱼ are Julia types. This allows  us to represent a Mealy machine with (Int + String)-many input doors, for  example.
