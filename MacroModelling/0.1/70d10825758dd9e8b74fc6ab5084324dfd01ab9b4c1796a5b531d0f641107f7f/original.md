```julia
get_steady_state_equations(𝓂)

```

Return the non-stochastic steady state (NSSS) equations of the model. The difference to the equations as they were written in the `@model` block is that exogenous shocks are set to `0`, time subscripts are eliminated (e.g. `c[-1]` becomes `c`), trivial simplifications are carried out (e.g. `log(k) - log(k) = 0`), and auxilliary variables are added for expressions that cannot become negative. 

Auxilliary variables facilitate the solution of the NSSS problem. The package substitutes expressions which cannot become negative with auxilliary variables and adds another equation to the system of equations determining the NSSS. For example, `log(c/q)` cannot be negative and `c/q` is substituted by an auxilliary varaible `➕₁` and an additional equation is added: `➕₁ = c / q`.

Note that the ouput assumes the equations are equal to 0. As in, `-z{δ} * ρ{δ} + z{δ}` implies `-z{δ} * ρ{δ} + z{δ} = 0` and therefore: `z{δ} * ρ{δ} = z{δ}`.

# Arguments

  * `𝓂`: object created by [`@model`](@ref) and [`@parameters`](@ref).

# Returns

  * `Vector{String}` of the NSSS equations.
