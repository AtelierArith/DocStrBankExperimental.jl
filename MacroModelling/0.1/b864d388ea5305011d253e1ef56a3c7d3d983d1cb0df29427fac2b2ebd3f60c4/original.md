```julia
get_dynamic_equations(𝓂)

```

Return the augmented system of equations describing the model dynamics. Augmented means that, in case of variables with leads or lags larger than 1, or exogenous shocks with leads or lags, the system is augemented by auxilliary equations containing variables in lead or lag. The augmented system features only variables which are in the present `[0]`, future `[1]`, or past `[-1]`. For example, `Δk_4q[0] = log(k[0]) - log(k[-3])` contains `k[-3]`. By introducing 2 auxilliary variables (`kᴸ⁽⁻¹⁾` and `kᴸ⁽⁻²⁾` with `ᴸ` being the lead/lag operator) and augmenting the system (`kᴸ⁽⁻²⁾[0] = kᴸ⁽⁻¹⁾[-1]` and `kᴸ⁽⁻¹⁾[0] = k[-1]`) we can ensure that the timing is smaller than 1 in absolute terms: `Δk_4q[0] - (log(k[0]) - log(kᴸ⁽⁻²⁾[-1]))`.

In case programmatic model writing was used this function returns the parsed equations (see loop over shocks in example).

Note that the ouput assumes the equations are equal to 0. As in, `kᴸ⁽⁻¹⁾[0] - k[-1]` implies `kᴸ⁽⁻¹⁾[0] - k[-1] = 0` and therefore: `kᴸ⁽⁻¹⁾[0] = k[-1]`.
