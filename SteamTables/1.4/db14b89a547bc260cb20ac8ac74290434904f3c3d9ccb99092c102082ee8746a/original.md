Temperature_Ph(P, h)

Utility function that returns the Temperature [K] from P [MPa] and s [kJ/kg/K]
The explicit backwards equations are only available in regions 1 and 2. For Region 3 and 5 there is an implicit solver that may fail. Input outside these
will result in a DomainError exception.
If inputs have associated units, the value is returned with associated
units of K via Uniful.jl.
