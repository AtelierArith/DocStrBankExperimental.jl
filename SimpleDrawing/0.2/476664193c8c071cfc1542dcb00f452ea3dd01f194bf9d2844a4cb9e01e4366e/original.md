```
draw_disc(x,y,r)
```

Draw a disc centered at `(x,y)` and with radius `r`. May also be invoked as:

  * `draw_disc(z,r)` where `z` is complex.
  * `draw_disc(a,b,c)` where `a,b,c` are complex which gives a disc passing through `a`, `b`, and `c`.

For example: `draw_disc(0,1,3; color=:yellow, linecolor=:red)`
