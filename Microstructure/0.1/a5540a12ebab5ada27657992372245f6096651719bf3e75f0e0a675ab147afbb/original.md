All models in this page belong to the BiophysicalModel Type. You can also build your models with desired combinations of compartments using a similar syntax.  In each model, all compartmental parameters can be considered "free parameters" and sampled using MCMC.  This is designed to offer maximum flexibility in adjusting model assumptions, but it doesn't guarantee reliable estimation of all parameters.  It's common that we need to fix or link some tissue parameters based on our data measurement protocols and our tissue parameters of interest. Parameter fixing and linking can be achieved by settings in MCMC sampler in the estimator module.
