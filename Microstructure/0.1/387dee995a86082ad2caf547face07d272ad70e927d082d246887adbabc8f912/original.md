Compartment Type is an abstract type that includes the `Cylinder`, `Stick`, `Zeppelin`, `Sphere` and `Iso` type.  A Compartment Type object contains relevant tissue parameters that affect the MRI signals. Each type of compartment contain a `t2` field for combined-diffusion-T2 imaging.  When your data supports only T2-weighted compartment modelling, i.e. acquired with single-TE,  set the `t2` field to zero for conventional dMRI modelling.
