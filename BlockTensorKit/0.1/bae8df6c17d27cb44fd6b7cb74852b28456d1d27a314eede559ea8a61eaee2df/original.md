```
AbstractBlockTensorMap{E,S,N₁,N₂}
```

Abstract supertype for tensor maps that have additional block structure, i.e. they act on vector spaces that have a direct sum structure. These behave like `AbstractTensorMap` but have additional methods to facilitate indexing and manipulation of the block structure.
