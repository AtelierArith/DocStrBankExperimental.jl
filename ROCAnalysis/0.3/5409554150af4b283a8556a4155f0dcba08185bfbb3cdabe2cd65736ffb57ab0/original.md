eer(tar, non)
```

Computes a simple approximation to the Equal Error Rate,  the intersection of the ROC with the line `y=x`, i.e., the error rate at which the false positive rate and the false negative rate are approximately equal.

For a more consistent interpretation and implementation of the EER, please consider `eerch()`, the Equal Error Rate - Convex Hull computation.
