```
WeightedSampling(size, [weights]; replace=false, ordered=false)
```

Sample elements from a given domain/data using `weights`. Produce a sample of given `size` with or without replacement depending on the `replace` option. The option `ordered` can be used to return samples in the same order of the original domain/data. By default weights are uniform.
