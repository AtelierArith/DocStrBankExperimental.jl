```
Cylinder(bottom, top, radius)
```

A solid circular cylinder embedded in RÂ³ with given `radius`, delimited by `bottom` and `top` planes.

```
Cylinder(start, finish, radius)
```

Alternatively, construct a right circular cylinder with given `radius` along the segment with `start` and `finish` end points.

```
Cylinder(start, finish)
```

Or construct a right circular cylinder with unit radius along the segment with `start` and `finish` end points.

```
Cylinder(radius)
```

Finally, construct a right vertical circular cylinder with given `radius`.
