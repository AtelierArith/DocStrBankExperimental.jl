Compute the convex hull of a set of points or geometries using the Jarvis's march algorithm. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift*wrapping*algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_wrapping_algorithm).

The algorithm has complexity `O(n*h)` where `n` is the number of points and `h` is the number of points in the hull.
