DehnTriangulation()
```

Max Dehns' triangulation proved in 1899.

The algorithm is described in the first chapter of Devadoss & Rourke 2011, and is based on a theorem derived in 1899 by the German mathematician Max Dehn. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_ears_theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_ears_theorem).

Because the algorithm relies on recursion, it is mostly appropriate for polygons with small number of vertices.
