```
PointSet(points)
```

A set of `points` (a.k.a. point cloud) representing a [`Domain`](@ref).

## Examples

All point sets below are the same and contain two points in R³:

```julia
julia> PointSet([Point(1,2,3), Point(4,5,6)])
julia> PointSet(Point(1,2,3), Point(4,5,6))
julia> PointSet([(1,2,3), (4,5,6)])
julia> PointSet((1,2,3), (4,5,6))
```
