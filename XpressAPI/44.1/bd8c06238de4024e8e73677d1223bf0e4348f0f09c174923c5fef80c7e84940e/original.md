```

Determines if second order cone constraints should be used for inferring bound reductions on variables when solving a MIP. (integer)

Default value: `-1`

Values: -1 : Automatic. 0 : Disable bound reductions from second order cone constraints. 1 : Enable bound reductions from second order cone constraints.
