```
XPRS_GLOBALSPATIALBRANCHPROPAGATIONEFFORT
```

Limits the effort that is spent on propagation during spatial branching. (double)

Default value: -1.0

Values: -1 : The algorithm chooses the effort limit automatically (default). 0 : Disables propagation on branching entities. n>0 : Relative effort to spend on propagating on branching entities. Higher values lead to more propagation.
