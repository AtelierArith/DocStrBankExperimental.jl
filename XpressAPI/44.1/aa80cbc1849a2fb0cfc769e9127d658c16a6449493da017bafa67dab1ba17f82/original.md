```

This control determines which algorithm is to be used to solve mixed integer quadratic constrained and mixed integer second order cone problems. (integer)

Default value: `-1`

Values: -1 : Determined automatically. 0 : Use the barrier algorithm in the branch and bound algorithm. 1 : Use outer approximations in the branch and bound algorithm.
