XPRS_FEASTOLPERTURB
```

This tolerance determines how much a feasible primal basic solution is allowed to be perturbed when performing basis changes. (double)

The tolerance `FEASTOL` is always considered as an upper limit for the perturbations, but in some cases smaller value can be more desirable.

Default value: `1.0E-06`
