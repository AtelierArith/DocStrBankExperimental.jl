```
XPRS_TREEFILESIZE
```

The allocated size of the tree file, in megabytes. (integer)

Because data can be removed from the tree file during the branch and bound search, the size of the tree file is usually greater than the amount of data currently within it (represented by the TREEFILEUSAGE attribute).
