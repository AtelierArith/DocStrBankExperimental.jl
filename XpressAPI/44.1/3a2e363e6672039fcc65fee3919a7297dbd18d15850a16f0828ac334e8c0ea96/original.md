```
XPRS_LPITERLIMIT
```

The maximum number of iterations that will be performed by primal simplex or dual simplex before the optimization process terminates. (integer)

For MIP problems, this is the maximum total number of iterations over all nodes explored by the Branch and Bound method.

Default value: `2147483647`

Domain: 0~+INF
