```
XPRS_GLOBALBOUNDINGBOXAPPLIED
```

Whether a bounding box equal to the absolute value of the GLOBALBOUNDINGBOX control was applied to the problem after the initial solve came back infeasible and if so, to which variables. (double)

Values: 0 : No bounding box applied(`XPRS_GLOBALBOUNDINGBOX_NOT_APPLIED`). 1 : Bounding box applied to all original variables(`XPRS_GLOBALBOUNDINGBOX_ORIGINAL`). 2 : Bounding box applied to all original and auxiliary variables(`XPRS_GLOBALBOUNDINGBOX_AUXILIARY`).
