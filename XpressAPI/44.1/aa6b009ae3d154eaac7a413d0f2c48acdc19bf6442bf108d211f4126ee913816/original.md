Presolve: reformulate problems with a non-diagonal quadratic objective and/or constraints as diagonal quadratic or second-order conic constraints. (integer)

Default value: `-1`

Values: -1 : Automatically determined. 0 : Disable reformulation. 1 : Enable reformulation to diagonal quadratic constraints. 2 : Enable reformulation to diagonal quadratic constraints and reduction to second-order cones.
