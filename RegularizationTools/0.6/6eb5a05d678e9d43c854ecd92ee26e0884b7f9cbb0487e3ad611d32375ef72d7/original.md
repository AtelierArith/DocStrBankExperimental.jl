```
designmatrix(s::Any, q::Any, f::Function)::AbstractMatrix
```

  * s is an array of setpoints
  * q is an array of query points
  * f is a function that maps the functor [Domain](@ref) to a solution y

The function to creates an array of domain nodes using the standard basis eáµ¢ of  the vector space. The setpoint or query point can be any abstract notion of the  input. For examples, a numerical value corresponding to a setting, a string label  (["bin A", "bin B", ...), or a list of pixel coordinate [(1,1), (1,2), ...].  The function f must accept a single argument of type [Domain](@ref) and provide a  numerical mapping between input $x$ and output $y$ at query point $q$. The function designmatrix then returns a design matrix $\mathbf{A}$ such that 

$y = \mathbf{A}x$

where x is an array of numerical input values. In the case that [q] = [s], the  shortcut `designmatrix(s, f)` can be used.
