MitchellNetravaliSpline([T=Float64,] [b=1/3, c=1/3,] B=Flat)
```

yields an instance of the Mitchell & Netravali family of kernels for floating-point type `T`, parameters `b` and `c` and boundary conditions `B`.

These kernels are cubic splines which depends on 2 parameters, `b` and `c`. Whatever the values of `(b,c)`, all these kernels are normalized, even functions of class CÂ¹ (these kernels and their first derivatives are continuous).

Taking `b = 0` yields Keys's family of kernels and is a sufficient and necessary condition to have Mitchell & Netravali kernels be cardinal functions.

Using the constraint: `b + 2c = 1` yields a cubic filter with, at least, quadratic order approximation.

Some specific values of `(b,c)` yield other well known kernels:

```
(b,c) = (1,0)       ==> cubic B-spline
(b,c) = (0,-a)      ==> Keys's cardinal cubics
(b,c) = (0,(1-a)/2) ==> cardinal cubic spline
(b,c) = (0,1/2)     ==> Catmull-Rom cubics
(b,c) = (b,0)       ==> Duff's tensioned B-spline
(b,c) = (1/3,1/3)   ==> recommended by Mitchell-Netravali
```

The expression `ker'` yields a kernel instance which is the 1st derivative of the Mitchell & Netravali kernel `ker` (also see the constructor [`MitchellNetravaliSplinePrime`](@ref)).
