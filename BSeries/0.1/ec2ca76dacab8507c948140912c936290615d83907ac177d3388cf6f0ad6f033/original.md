elementary_differentials(fs::NTuple{2, AbstractVector}, u, order)
```

Compute all elementary differentials of the sum of the two vector fields `f` with independent variables `u` up to the given `order`. The return value can be indexed by (bi-) colored rooted trees to obtain the corresponding elementary differential.
