Add individuals to a population

Add individuals to an existing population. `n` individuals are added to the population with an initialized set of process counters (indicators set to zero). `h1..5` are used to supply the indicator value of each counter (used as individual's age or fraction of development attained). Individuals can also be added by passing a second `Population` object which will be added to the first.
