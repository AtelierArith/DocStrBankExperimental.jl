Iterate a population

Update a population over a single time step. NamedTuples convey information about each process in the order they are added. For age-dependent and accumative processes, `devmn` indicates the current mean development time, and `devsd` its standard deviation. For custom or constant-rate processes, `prob` indicates the probability of completing.
