A population member class

A struct containing the state of a group of individuals with the same qualities. In current implementation, at most 5 different qualities are allowed in a state. The struct can be constructed by passing the process indicator (e.g. age, development indicator, etc.) to its constructor. It can also be constructed with a hazard data type or a list of hazards and an instructed change in one of the process counters.
