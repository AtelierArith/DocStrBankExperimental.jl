Layer(thi,V,W,X,q)
Computed Eigenmodes and propagation properties of a layer
thi: layer thickness
V: coordinate transform between eigenmode amplitude and magnetic field
W: coordinate transform between eigenmode amplitude and electric field
X: transmission of amplitude vector through the layer
q: effective propagation constant of the eigenmodes
