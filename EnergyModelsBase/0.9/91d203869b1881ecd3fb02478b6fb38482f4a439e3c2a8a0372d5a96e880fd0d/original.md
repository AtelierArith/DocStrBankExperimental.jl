abstract type Accumulating <: StorageBehavior
```

`Accumulating` as supertype for an accumulating storage level.

Accumulating storage behaviour implies that the change in the overall storage level in a strategic period can be both positive or negative.

Examples for potential usage of `Accumulating` are CO₂ storages in which the CO₂ is permanently stored or multi year hydropower magazines.
