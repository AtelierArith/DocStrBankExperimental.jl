```
StationaryStrategyConfig
```

A configuration for a strategy cache that stores stationary policies. Note that the strategy is updated at each iteration of the value iteration algorithm, if a new choice is strictly better than the previous one. See [1, Section 4.3] for more details why this is necessary. See [`construct_strategy_cache`](@ref) for more details on how to construct the cache from the configuration.
