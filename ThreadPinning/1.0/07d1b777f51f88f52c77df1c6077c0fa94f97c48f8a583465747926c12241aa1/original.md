Returns all CPU IDs of the system/compute node (logical index, starts at 1). By default, an "cores before hyperthreads" ordering is used. Set `compact=true` if you want compact ordering. Set `shuffle=true` to randomize.

Optional second argument: Logical indices to select a subset of the CPU-threads.
