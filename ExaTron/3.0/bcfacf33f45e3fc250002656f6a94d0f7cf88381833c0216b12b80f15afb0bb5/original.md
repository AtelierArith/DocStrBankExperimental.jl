Subroutine dspcg

This subroutine generates a sequence of approximate minimizers for the subproblem

```
min { q(x) : xl <= x <= xu }.
```

The quadratic is defined by

```
q(x[0]+s) = 0.5*s'*A*s + g'*s,
```

where x[0] is a base point provided by the user, A is a symmetric matrix in compressed column storage, and g is a vector.

At each stage we have an approximate minimizer x[k], and generate a direction p[k] by using a preconditioned conjugate gradient method on the subproblem

```
min { q(x[k]+p) : || L'*p || <= delta, s(fixed) = 0 },
```

where fixed is the set of variables fixed at x[k], delta is the trust region bound, and L is an incomplete Cholesky factorization of the submatrix

```
B = A(free:free),
```

where free is the set of free variables at x[k]. Given p[k], the next minimizer x[k+1] is generated by a projected search.

The starting point for this subroutine is x[1] = x[0] + s, where x[0] is a base point and s is the Cauchy step.

The subroutine converges when the step s satisfies

```
|| (g + A*s)[free] || <= rtol*|| g[free] ||
```

In this case the final x is an approximate minimizer in the face defined by the free variables.

The subroutine terminates when the trust region bound does not allow further progress, that is, || L'*p[k] || = delta. In this case the final x satisfies q(x) < q(x[k]).
