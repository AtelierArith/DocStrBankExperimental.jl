```
b = GeneralLazyBufferCache(f=identity)
```

A lazily allocated buffer object.  Given an array `u`, `b[u]` returns a cache object generated by `f(u)`, but the generator is only run the first time (and all subsequent times it reuses the same cache)

## Limitation

The main limitation of this method is that its return is not type-inferred, and thus it can be slower than some other preallocation techniques. However, if used correct using things like function barriers, then this is a general technique that is sufficiently fast.
