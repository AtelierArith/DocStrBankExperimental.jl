```
FPDistribution(T, A, p0)
```

Creates a new first-passage time distribution from the transient transition rate matrix T, the absorbing transition rate matrix A, and the vector of initial probabilities of the transient states p0.

Checks to make sure that the inputs meet the requirements for being a first passage time distribution for a continuous-time, discrete-state Markov process.
