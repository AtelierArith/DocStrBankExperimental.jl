return the continuous wavelet transform along the first axis with averaging. `wave`, is (signalLength)×(nscales+1)×(previous dimensions), of type T of Y. averagingLength defines the number of octaves (powers of 2) that are replaced by an averaging function. This has form averagingType, which can be one of `Mother()` or `Dirac()`- in the `Mother()` case, it uses the same form as for the wavelets, while the `Dirac` uses a constant window. J1 is the total number of scales; default (when J1=NaN, or is negative) is just under the maximum possible number, i.e. the log base 2 of the length of the signal, times the number of wavelets per octave. If you have sampling information, you will need to scale wave by δt^(1/2).
