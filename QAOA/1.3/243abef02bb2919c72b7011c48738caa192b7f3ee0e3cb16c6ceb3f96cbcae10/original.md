```
mean_field_solution(S::Vector{<:Vector{<:Real}})
```

### Input

  * `problem::Problem`: A `Problem` instance defining the optimization problem.
  * `β::Vector{<:Real}`: The vector of QAOA driver parameters.
  * `γ::Vector{<:Real}`: The vector of QAOA problem parameters.

### Output

  * The solution bitstring computed from a given vector of spin vectors.

### Notes

  * This is the second dispatch of `mean_field_solution`, which computes the solution bitstring from a given vector of spin vectors.
  * The solution bitstring $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_*$ is defined as follows in terms of the $z$ components of the spin vectors:

    $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_* = \left(\mathrm{sign}(n_1^z), ..., \mathrm{sign}(n_N^z) \right).$
