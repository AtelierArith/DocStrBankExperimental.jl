Values in a `RelationalContainer` are accessed by name or symbol. In both cases the name/symbol belongs to a particular namespace. When accessed by symbol, parent-child relationships are recognised for both key and non-key data names. So, for example, if category `atom_site_aniso` is a child category of `atom_site`, then member `u11` of `atom_site_aniso` can be accessed as `:atom_site_aniso, :u_11`, `:atom_site, :u_11` and `"_atom_site_aniso.u_11"`.

Similarly, if the key data name for both categories is `<cat name>.label`, then a particular row in either category can be indicated using all four forms: `:atom_site, :label`, `:atom_site_aniso, :label`, "*atom*site.label" or "*atom*site_aniso.label". This latter behaviour arises because of the equivalence of key data names.
