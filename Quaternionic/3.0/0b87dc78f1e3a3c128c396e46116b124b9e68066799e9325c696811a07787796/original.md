```
from_euler_phases(z‚Çê, z·µ¶, z·µß)
from_euler_phases(z)
```

Return the quaternion corresponding to these Euler phases.

Interpreting the input quaternion as a rotation (though its normalization scales out), we can define the complex Euler phases from the Euler angles (Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥) as

```
z‚Çê ‚âî exp(i*Œ±)
z·µ¶ ‚âî exp(i*Œ≤)
z·µß ‚âî exp(i*Œ≥)
```

These are more useful geometric quantites than the angles themselves ‚Äî being involved in computing spherical harmonics and Wigner's ùîá matrices ‚Äî and can be computed from the components of the corresponding quaternion algebraically (without the use of transcendental functions).

# Parameters

  * `z::Vector{Complex{T}}`: complex vector of length 3, representing the complex phases (z‚Çê, z·µ¶, z·µß) in that order.

# Returns

  * `R::Quaternion{T}`
