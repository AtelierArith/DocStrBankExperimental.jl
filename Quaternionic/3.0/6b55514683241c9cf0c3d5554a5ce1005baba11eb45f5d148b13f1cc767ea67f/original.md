Convert input quaternion to complex phases of Euler angles

Interpreting the input quaternion as a rotation (though its normalization scales out), we can define the complex Euler phases from the Euler angles (Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥) as

```
z‚Çê ‚âî exp(i*Œ±)
z·µ¶ ‚âî exp(i*Œ≤)
z·µß ‚âî exp(i*Œ≥)
```

These are more useful geometric quantites than the angles themselves ‚Äî being involved in computing spherical harmonics and Wigner's ùîá matrices ‚Äî and can be computed from the components of the corresponding quaternion algebraically (without the use of transcendental functions).

Note that `to_euler_phases!(z, q)` is supported for backwards compatibility, but because this function returns an `SVector`, there is probably no advantage to the in-place approach.

# Returns

  * `z::SVector{Complex{T}}`: complex phases (z‚Çê, z·µ¶, z·µß) in that order.
