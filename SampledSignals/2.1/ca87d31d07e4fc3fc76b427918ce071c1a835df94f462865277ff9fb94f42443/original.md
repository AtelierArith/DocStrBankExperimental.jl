Represents a multi-channel regularly-sampled buffer that stores its own sample rate (in samples/second). The wrapped data is an N-dimensional array. A 1-channel sample can be represented with a 1D array or an Mx1 matrix, and a C-channel buffer will be an MxC matrix. So a 1-second stereo audio buffer sampled at 44100Hz with 32-bit floating-point samples in the time domain would have the type SampleBuf{Float32, 2}.
