Find the Wade-Giles of a Hanzi reference string. Arguments:     `reference::String`: The Hanzi string.     Optional:     `multiple::Bool=false`: Whether to return multiple pronunciations for characters with multiple pronunciations. Returns:     `::Vector{Vector{String}}`: If `multiple` is `false`, a vector of single-item vectors with Hanzi pronunciations.         If `multiple` is `true`, a vector of variable-length vectors, with each containing the possible pronunciations.
