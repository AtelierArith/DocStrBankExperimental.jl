Module for jet reconstruction algorithms and utilities.

This module provides various algorithms and utilities for jet reconstruction in high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. It includes functions for performing jet clustering with different algorithms and strategies.

Utility functions are also provided for reading input from HepMC3 files, saving and loading jet objects, and visualizing jets.

# Usage

To use this module, include it in your Julia code and call the desired functions or use the exported types. See the documentation for each function and the examples in this package for more information.
