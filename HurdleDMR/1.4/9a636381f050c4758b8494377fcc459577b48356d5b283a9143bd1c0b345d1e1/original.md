srproj calculates the MNIR Sufficient Reduction projection from text counts on to the attribute dimensions of interest (covars in mnlm). In particular, for counts C, with row sums m, and mnlm coefficients φ*j corresponding to attribute j, z*j = C'φ*j/m is the SR projection in the direction of j. The MNIR paper explains how V=[v*1 ... v*K], your original covariates/attributes, are independent of text counts C given SR projections Z=[z*1 ... z_K]. dir == nothing returns projections in all directions.
