calculateBGT(z,Qᵦ,T₁₂,Eₓ,Iᵦ)

calculate beta decay strength of an isotope given partial branching ratios to excited states

z: Atomic number of the parent

Qᵦ: β decay Q value in MeV

T₁₂: beta decay half-life

Eₓ: vector of daughter states relative to the ground state energy in MeV

Iᵦ: vector of Iᵦ values
