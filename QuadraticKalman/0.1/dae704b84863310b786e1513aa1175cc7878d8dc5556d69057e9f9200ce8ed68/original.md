```
KalmanSmootherPlot{M<:SmootherOutput{<:Real}}
```

A container for generating visualizations of Kalman smoother outputs. This type encapsulates the results of the smoother, which typically include smoothed state estimates and the corresponding covariance matrices, providing a unified interface for plotting these outputs along with their confidence intervals.

# Fields

  * `results::M`: An instance of `SmootherOutput` that contains:

      * `Z_smooth`: A matrix of the smoothed state estimates.
      * `P_smooth`: A three-dimensional array of the smoothed state covariances.

    These outputs are generated by executing a backward recursion that refines state estimates using future information.

# Usage

This type is used internally by the plotting recipes to produce diagnostic plots that display the smoother’s performance. The standard visualizations enable users to visually compare the smoothed state trajectories against true state values (or other benchmarks), with uncertainty represented as confidence intervals. This facilitates a detailed analysis of the model’s estimation efficiency and convergence properties.

# Details

By encapsulating the smoother results, `KalmanSmootherPlot` simplifies the integration of smoothing diagnostics into the plotting framework. The associated plots typically illustrate:

  * The estimated state trajectories over time.
  * The uncertainty in these estimates, often depicted using shaded regions corresponding to a 95% confidence interval.

This enhanced visualization aids in assessing the accuracy and reliability of the smoothing procedure.
