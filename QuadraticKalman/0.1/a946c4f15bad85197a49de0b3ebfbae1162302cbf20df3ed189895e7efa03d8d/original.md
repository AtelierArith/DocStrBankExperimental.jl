```
KalmanFilterPlot{M<:FilterOutput{<:Real}}
```

An abstraction for constructing detailed visualizations of Kalman filter outcomes. This type is designed to encapsulate all necessary components for plotting the evolution of state estimates, along with the corresponding uncertainty measures, over time. It serves as a central piece within the plotting recipes framework, enabling users to create diagnostic graphics that compare filtered state trajectories against observed data, thereby providing deep insights into the performance and reliability of the Kalman filter.

# Fields

  * `results::M`: The filtering results computed from a Kalman filter run, expected to be an instance of `FilterOutput`. This container typically includes:

      * Filtered state estimates (`Z_tt`): The real-time estimates of the states.
      * Covariance matrices (`P_tt`): The corresponding error covariances associated with the state estimates.
      * Log-likelihood values (`ll_t`): Metrics that indicate the goodness-of-fit at each time step.
      * Supplementary outputs such as one-step-ahead predictions and other auxiliary statistics necessary for an in-depth analysis of the filtering process.

# Details

This type is intended for internal use by the plotting recipes module to standardize and streamline the visualization process. Its role is to facilitate the generation of clear and informative plots that not only display the state estimates but also visually represent the associated uncertainty through confidence intervals. This makes it easier to assess the dynamic behavior of the filter, detect potential issues, and diagnose problems related to model fit and convergence.

The comprehensive documentation provided here ensures that users extending or interfacing with the plotting system will have a complete understanding of the type's purpose and structure, thereby enhancing the overall diagnostic workflow.
