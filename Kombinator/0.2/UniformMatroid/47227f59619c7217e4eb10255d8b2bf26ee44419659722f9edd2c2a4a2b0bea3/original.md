An instance of the uniform-matroid problem. It is sometimes called the m-set problem. 

Any set of `m` values or fewer is a solution. More formally, the independent  sets are the sets containing at most `m` elements.

It can be formalised as follows:

$\max \sum_i \mathrm{rewards}_i x_i$ $\mathrm{s.t.} \sum_i x_i \leq m, \quad x \in \{0, 1\}^d$
