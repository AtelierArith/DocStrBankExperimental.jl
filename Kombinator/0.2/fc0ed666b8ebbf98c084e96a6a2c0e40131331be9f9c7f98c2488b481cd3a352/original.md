abstract type CombinatorialAlgorithm
```

One specific combinatorial algorithm to solve an instance. Given as a parameter  to `solve`, it specifies the way the instance should be solved. 

As often as possible, generic objects are provided with usual names (e.g.,  a greedy algorithm can be proposed for many different problems: the actual  implementation will depend on the type of the combinatorial instance at hand).
