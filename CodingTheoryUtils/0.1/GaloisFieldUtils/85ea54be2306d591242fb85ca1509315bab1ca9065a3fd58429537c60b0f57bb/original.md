```
trace(a::F)::F2 where F <: GaloisFields.AbstractGaloisField
```

Calculate the trace of a Galois field element.

# Arguments

  * `a::F`: A Galois field element

# Returns

  * `F2`: The trace of the element (0 or 1)

# Notes

  * The trace of an element a in GF(2^m) is defined as Tr(a) = a + a^2 + a^4 + ... + a^(2^(m-1))
  * The trace is always an element of the base field GF(2)
  * The trace is a linear function over GF(2)
  * The trace of zero is zero
