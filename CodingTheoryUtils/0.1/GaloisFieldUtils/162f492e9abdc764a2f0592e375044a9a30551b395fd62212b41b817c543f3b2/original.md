```
get_tr_one_elem(a::F)::F where F <: GaloisFields.AbstractGaloisField
```

Find an element in the Galois field whose trace is 1.

# Arguments

  * `a::F`: A non-zero Galois field element (assumed to be a primitive element)

# Returns

  * `F`: An element whose trace is 1

# Throws

  * `AssertionError`: If the input element is zero

# Notes

  * This function finds an element b such that trace(b) = 1
  * Such an element always exists in a finite field of characteristic 2
  * The returned element can be used as a basis element for the trace-dual basis
