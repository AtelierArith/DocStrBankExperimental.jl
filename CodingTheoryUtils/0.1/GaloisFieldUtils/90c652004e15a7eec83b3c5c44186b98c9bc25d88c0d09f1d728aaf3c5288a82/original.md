```
bvec(α::Fe)::Vector{F2}
```

Convert a Galois field element to its binary vector representation. The length of the output vector is equal to the extension degree of the field.

# Arguments

  * `α::Fe`: A Galois field element

# Returns

  * `Vector{F2}`: Binary vector representation of the element
