Solve the system `F` using a total degree homotopy. This returns a path tracker ([`EndgameTracker`](@ref) or [`OverdeterminedTracker`](@ref)) and an iterator to compute the start solutions. If the system `F` has declared `variable_groups` then a multi-homogeneous a start system following [^Wam93] will be constructed.
