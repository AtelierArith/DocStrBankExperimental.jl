compute_trajectory(u,v,X₀,Trange::Tuple[;dt=0.01])

Calculate the trajectory of a tracer particle with initial location(s) `X₀`, which can be specified as either a single vector `[x0,y0]`, a vector of vectors specifying x, y pairs, or a tuple of vectors or arrays specifying x and y positions, respectively, for multiple tracer particles. The arguments `u` and `v` are either interpolated velocity field components from a computational solution or are functions. If they are functions, then each of them should be of the form `u(x,y,t)` and `v(x,y,t)`; `Trange` is a tuple of the initial and final time of integration (and the final time can be earlier than the initial time if backward trajectories are desired); and `dt` is the time step size, which defaults to 0.001. The output is the solution structure for the `OrdinaryDiffEq` package (or, for multiple particles, a vector of such solution structures).
