compute_streamline(u,v,X₀,srange::Tuple,t::Real,[;dt=0.01])

Calculate the streamline(s) passing through location(s) `X₀`, which can be specified as either a single vector `[x0,y0]`, a vector of vectors specifying x, y pairs, or a tuple of vectors or arrays specifying x and y positions, respectively, for a rake of streamlines. The arguments `u` and `v` are either interpolated velocity field components from a computational solution or are functions. If they are functions, then each of them should be of the form `u(x,y,t)` and `v(x,y,t)`; `srange` is a tuple of the initial and final time of integration; `t` is the current time at which the streamline is depicted; and `Δs` is the time-like step size, which defaults to 0.001. The output is the solution structure for the `OrdinaryDiffEq` package (or, for multiple points, a vector of such solution structures).
