The integration time is fit by integrating the dim flash response and dividing it by the dim flash response amplitude

  * A key to note here is that the exact f(x) of the ERG data is not completely known
  * The integral is therefore a defininte integral and a sum of the area under the curve
  * This equation is according to    Baylor DA, Hodgkin AL (1973) Detection and resolution of visual stimuli       by turtle photoreceptors. J Physiol 234:163â€“198.
