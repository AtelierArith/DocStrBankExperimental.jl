Conductor(material::String)
```

Outer constructor for `conductor` types.  Material specified needs to have the following data in the database:

  * ρ (density): Density [kg/m³]
  * resistivity: Resistivity [Ω⋅m]
  * α (alpha: Thermal coefficient of resisitivity [K⁻¹]
  * T0: Temperature at base resistivity [K]
