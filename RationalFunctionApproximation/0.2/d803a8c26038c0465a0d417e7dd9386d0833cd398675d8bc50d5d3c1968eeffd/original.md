convergenceplot(r)
```

Plot the convergence history of a rational approximation.

Markers show the maximum error on (the boundary of) the domain as a function of the numerator/denominator degree. A red marker indicates that the approximation has disallowed poles in its domain. A gold halo highlights the best approximation.
