SimplicialSets
```

This package provides types and functions to work with simplicial sets. Various kinds of simplicial sets are supported, including symbolic simplices, products, bar constructions and Kan loop groups. The Eilenbergâ€“Zilber maps and interval cut operations are also implemented.

The package uses `LinearCombinations.jl` to represent formal linear combinations of simplices and other objects. By default, coefficients are of type `Int`.
