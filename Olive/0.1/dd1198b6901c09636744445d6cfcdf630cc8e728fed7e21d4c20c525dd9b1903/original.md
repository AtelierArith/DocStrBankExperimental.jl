```julia
build(c::Connection, cm::ComponentModifier, p::Project{<:Any}) -> ::Component{:div}
```

The catchall/default `build` function for `Olive` projects. Extend this function to change  the way a new `Project` type is built. By default, this makes a simple window with generated cells as  children. The cells are similarly generated by calling `build`.

```julia
using Olive; Olive.start()

# (click your olive link to instantiate your environment)
import Olive: build

build(c::Connection, cm::ComponentModifier, p::Project{:newproject}) = begin
    div(p.id, children = [build(c, cm, p, cell) for cell in p[:cells]])
end

# you'll need to load the project type if it doesn't come from a file or extension:
push!(Olive.CORE.open[1].projects, Project{:newproject}(""))

# refresh the page!
```

Here are some other **important** functions to look at for a `Project`:

  * `source_module!`
  * `check!`
  * `work_preview`
  * `open_project`
  * `close_project`
  * `save_project`
  * `save_project_as`
  * `olive_save`
  * `build_tab`
  * `style_tab_closed!`
  * `tab_controls`
  * `switch_pane!`
  * `step_evaluate`

Notably, all of the `Cell` functions are also dispatched to projects, so we can also  use these methods to change what different projects do with different cell types.
