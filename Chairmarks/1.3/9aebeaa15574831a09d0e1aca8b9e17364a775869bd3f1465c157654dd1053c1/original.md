```
struct Benchmark
    samples::Vector{Sample}
    ...more fields may be added...
end
```

A struct representing a complete benchmark result. Returned by [`@be`](@ref).

More fields may be added in the future to represent non sample specific information.

The functions `minimum` and `maximum` are defined field wise on `Benchmark` objects and return [`Sample`](@ref)s. On Julia 1.9 and above, the functions `Statistics.median`, `Statistics.mean`, and `Statistics.quantile` are also defined field wise on `Benchmark` objects and return `Sample`s.
