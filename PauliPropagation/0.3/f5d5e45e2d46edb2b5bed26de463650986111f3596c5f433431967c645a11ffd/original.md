```
propagate(circ, pstr::PauliString, thetas=nothing; max_weight=Inf, min_abs_coeff=1e-10, max_freq=Inf, max_sins=Inf, customtruncfunc=nothing, kwargs...)
```

Propagate a `PauliString` through the circuit `circ` in the Heisenberg picture.  This means that the circuit is applied to the Pauli string in reverse order, and the action of each gate is its conjugate action. Parameters for the parametrized gates in `circ` are given by `thetas`, and need to be passed as if the circuit was applied as written in the Schr√∂dinger picture. If thetas are not passed, the circuit must contain only non-parametrized `StaticGates`. Default truncations are `max_weight`, `min_abs_coeff`, `max_freq`, and `max_sins`. `max_freq`, and `max_sins` can only be used with `PauliFreqTracker` coefficients. A custom truncation function can be passed as `customtruncfunc` with the signature customtruncfunc(pstr::PauliStringType, coefficient)::Bool. Further `kwargs` are passed to the lower-level functions `applymergetruncate!`, `applytoall!`, `applyandadd!`, and `apply`.
