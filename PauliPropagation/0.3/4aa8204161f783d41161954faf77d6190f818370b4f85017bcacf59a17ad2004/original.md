    coeff::Real,

    min_abs_coeff::Float64
)
```

Custom truncation function with dissipation-assisted damping of coefficients.

This function damps the coefficient `coeff` scaling with the weight of an interger Pauli string `pstr`.  The damping factor is `gamma`.  If the coefficient, damped by an exponential factor, falls below `min_abs_coeff`,  the function returns `true` to indicate truncation.

# Arguments

  * `pstr::PauliStringType`: The Pauli string whose coefficient may be damped.
  * `coeff::Float64`: The coefficient associated with the Pauli string `pstr`.
  * `gamma::Float64`: Gamma, rate of exponential decay in the damping process.
  * `min_abs_coeff::Float64`: The minimum value of the coefficient for truncation.

# Returns

  * `Bool`: `true` if the damped coefficient of `pstr` < `min_abs_coeff`;   `false` otherwise.

# Details

The function evaluates the condition: `abs(coeff) * exp(-gamma * w(pstr)) < min_abs_coeff`

where `w(pstr)` is the weight of the Pauli string (computed by `countweight`).  The damping factor `gamma` controls the exponential decay.

# Examples

```julia truncatedampingcoeff(pstr, 0.8, 0.5, 0.01)
