This contains the results from a the fixed_point function.

It containing the following fields:

  * `FixedPoint_` - The `Vector` with the fixed point that has been found.
  * `Other_Output_` - The other output of the fixedpoint function.
  * `Convergence_` - A real number showing how close the `FixedPoint_` is to the input (to the function) that created it as output.
  * `TerminationCondition_' - Why did the fixedpoint acceleration stop.
  * `Iterations_' - How many iterations were undertaken
  * `ConvergenceVector_` - What is the convergence value at each iteration.
  * `FailedEvaluation_` - Why did the fixedpoint iteration fail (missing if it did not fail)
  * `Inputs_` - What were all of the inputs tried
  * `Outputs_` - What were all the corresponding outputs.
