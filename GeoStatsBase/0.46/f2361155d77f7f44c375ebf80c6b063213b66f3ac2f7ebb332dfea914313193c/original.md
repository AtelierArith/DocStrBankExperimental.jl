MinesightAngles(θ₁, θ₂, θ₃)
```

MineSight z-x'-y'' intrinsic rotation convention following the right-hand rule. All angles are in degrees and the sign convention is CW, CCW, CW positive.

The first rotation `θ₁` is a horizontal rotation around the Z-axis, with positive being clockwise. The second rotation `θ₂` is a rotation around the new X-axis, which moves the Y-axis into the desired position, with positive direction of rotation is up. The third rotation `θ₃` is a rotation around the new Y-axis, which moves the X-axis into the  desired position, with positive direction of rotation is up.
