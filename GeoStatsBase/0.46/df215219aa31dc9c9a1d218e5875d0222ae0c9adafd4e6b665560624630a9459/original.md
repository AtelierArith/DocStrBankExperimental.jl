GslibAngles(θ₁, θ₂, θ₃)
```

GSLIB z-x'-y'' intrinsic rotation convention following the left-hand rule. All angles are in degrees and the sign convention is CW, CCW, CW positive. Y is the principal axis.

The first rotation `θ₁` is a rotation around the Z-axis, this is also called the azimuth.  The second rotation `θ₂` is a rotation around the new X-axis, this is also called the dip.  The third rotation `θ₃` is a rotation around the new Y-axis, this is also called the tilt.
