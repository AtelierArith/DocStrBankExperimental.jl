`M = Maze(r,c)` creates an `r`-by-`c` maze. To see the maze, use `draw(M)`. The maze is meant to be solved from the upper left to the lower right. This is indicated by stars at those locations. To draw the maze without those stars, use `draw(M,false)`.

To draw the solution to the maze, use `draw_ans(M)`. The solutions is always drawn without stars.
