```
pfm(v::Vector{T}) where {T <: SeqOrView{<:Alphabet}}
```

Calculate the position frequency matrix (PFM) for a given vector of sequences or sequence views.

# Arguments

  * `v::Vector{T}`: A vector of sequences or sequence views, where each element is of type `T` which is a subtype of `SeqOrView` parameterized by an `Alphabet`.

# Returns

  * A matrix representing the position frequency matrix (PFM) of the input sequences.

# Details

  * The function first creates a copy of the input vector `v`.
  * It then determines the sequence with the maximum length (`vmax`) and removes it from the vector.
  * The function computes the Voss matrix for each sequence in the vector.
  * Finally, it sums the Voss matrices and returns the result as the position frequency matrix.
