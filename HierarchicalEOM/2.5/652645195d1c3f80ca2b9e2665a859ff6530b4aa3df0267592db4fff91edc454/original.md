HEOMsolve(M, ρ0, Δt, steps; e_ops, threshold, nonzero_tol, verbose, filename)
heomsolve(M, ρ0, Δt, steps; e_ops, threshold, nonzero_tol, verbose, filename)
```

Solve the time evolution for auxiliary density operators based on propagator (generated by `FastExpm.jl`).

# Parameters

  * `M::AbstractHEOMLSMatrix` : the matrix given from HEOM model
  * `ρ0::Union{QuantumObject,ADOs}` : system initial state (density matrix) or initial auxiliary density operators (`ADOs`)
  * `Δt::Real` : A specific time step (time interval).
  * `steps::Int` : The number of time steps
  * `e_ops::Union{Nothing,AbstractVector}`: List of operators for which to calculate expectation values.
  * `threshold::Real` : Determines the threshold for the Taylor series. Defaults to `1.0e-6`.
  * `nonzero_tol::Real` : Strips elements smaller than `nonzero_tol` at each computation step to preserve sparsity. Defaults to `1.0e-14`.
  * `verbose::Bool` : To display verbose output and progress bar during the process or not. Defaults to `true`.
  * `filename::String` : If filename was specified, the ADOs at each time point will be saved into the JLD2 file "filename.jld2" after the solving process.

# Notes

  * The [`ADOs`](@ref) will be saved depend on the keyword argument `e_ops`.
  * If `e_ops` is specified, the solution will only save the final `ADOs`, otherwise, it will save all the `ADOs` corresponding to `tlist = 0:Δt:(Δt * steps)`.
  * For more details of the propagator, please refer to [`FastExpm.jl`](https://github.com/fmentink/FastExpm.jl)

# Returns

  * `sol::TimeEvolutionHEOMSol` : The solution of the hierarchical EOM. See also [`TimeEvolutionHEOMSol`](@ref)

!!! note
    `heomsolve` is a synonym of `HEOMsolve`.
