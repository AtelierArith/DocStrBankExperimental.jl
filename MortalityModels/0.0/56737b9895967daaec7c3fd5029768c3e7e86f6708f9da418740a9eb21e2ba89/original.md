LC_SVD(mMu)

Input:
    mMu = matrix containing log forces of mortality for a given population

Output:
    vAx = constant age effects in a LC model
    vBx = age effects in a LC model 
    vKt = period effects in a LC model

Summary: function used to fit a LC model on the log force of mortality with a SVD decomposition
