LeftDivide(A, B, L)
```

Returns: a homalg matrix or fail

Let A, B and L be matrices having the same number of columns and defined over the same ring. The matrix LeftDivide( A, B, L ) is a particular solution of the inhomogeneous (one sided) linear system of equations AX+LY=B in case it is solvable (for some Y which is forgotten). Otherwise fail is returned. The name LeftDivide suggests "X=Aâˆ’1B modulo L"
