RightDivide(B, A, L)
```

Returns: a homalg matrix or fail

Let B, A and L be matrices having the same number of columns and defined over the same ring. The matrix RightDivide( B, A, L ) is a particular solution of the inhomogeneous (one sided) linear system of equations XA+YL=B in case it is solvable (for some Y which is forgotten). Otherwise fail is returned. The name RightDivide suggests "X=BAâˆ’1 modulo L".
