pseudodivision(f, g, x)
```

Computes the result of pseudodivision of `f` by `g` as univariate polynomials in `x` Input:

  * `f` - the polynomial to be divided
  * `g` - the polynomial to divide by
  * `x` - the variable for the division

Output: the pseudoremainder of `f` divided by `g` w.r.t. `x`
