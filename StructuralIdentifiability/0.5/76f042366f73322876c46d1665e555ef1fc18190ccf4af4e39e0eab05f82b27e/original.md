diffreduce(diffpoly, pbr)
```

Computes the result of differential reduction of a differential polynomial `diffpoly` with respect to the charset defined by a PB-representation `pbr` Input:

  * `diffpoly` - a polynomial representing a differential polynomial to be reduced
  * `pbr` - a projection-based representation

Output: the result of differential reduction of `diffpoly` by `pbr` considered as a characteristic set (see Remark 2.20 in the paper)
