Execute a statement. Statement to be executed can be DML, DDL, SET, etc. Optional `config` parameter can have additional keyword parameters that will be passed as configuration      properties that are overlayed on top of the the existing session configuration before this statement     is executed. They apply to this statement only and are not permanent. When async is true, execution is asynchronous and a PendingResult may be returned. If the returned value is a PendingResult:     - Caller must call `isready` on a PendingResult instance to check for completion.     - Once ready, calling `result` on it returns ResultSet (the same PendingResult instance is returned if it is still not ready)
