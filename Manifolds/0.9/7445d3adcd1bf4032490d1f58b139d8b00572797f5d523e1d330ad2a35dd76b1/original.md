```
project(M::KendallsPreShapeSpace, p, X)
```

Project tangent vector `X` at point `p` from the embedding to [`KendallsPreShapeSpace`](@ref) by selecting the right element from the tangent space to orthogonal section representing the quotient manifold `M`. See Section 3.7 of [SrivastavaKlassen:2016](@cite) for details.
