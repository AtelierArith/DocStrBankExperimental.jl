# `erdos_renyi_undirected`

Generate an undirected Erdős-Rényi graph. An undirected   Erdős-Rényi graph is generated by letting each undirected edge between `n` nodes be present with probability `p`.

There is another form of the call where the input is the average degree of the generated graph. 

**The current implementation uses sprand, this may change in the future.** **Do not depend on this routine for reliable output between versions.**

## Input

  * `n`: the number of nodes
  * `p`: the probability of an edge, or the average degree.   if $`p` >= 1$, then $`p`$ is interpreted as an average degree  instead of a probability. (There is no point in generating  an Erdős-Rényi graph with probability $`p`=1$)
  * `d`: The desired average degree, converted into a probabiltity   via d/n

## Functions

  * `erdos_renyi_undirected(n::Int,p::Float64)` specify the  probability or average degree
  * `erdos_renyi_undirected(n::Int,d::Int)` specify the average degree directly

## Output

  * A matrix network type for the Erdős-Rényi graph.

## Example

```
# show the connected phase transition
n = 100
avgdegs = linspace(1.,2*log(n),100) 
compsizes = map( (dbar) -> 
        maximum(scomponents(erdos_renyi_undirected(n,dbar)).sizes),
    avgdegs )
using Plots
unicodeplots()
plot(avgdegs,compsizes,xaxis=("average degree"),yaxis=("largest component size"))    
```
