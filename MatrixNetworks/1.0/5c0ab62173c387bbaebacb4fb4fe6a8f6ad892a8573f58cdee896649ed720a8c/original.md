# `erdos_renyi_directed`

Generate an directed Erdős-Rényi graph. A directed  Erdős-Rényi graph is generated by letting each directed edge between `n` nodes be present with probability `p`.

There is another form of the call where the input is the average degree of the generated graph. 

**The current implementation uses sprand, this may change in the future.** **Do not depend on this routine for reliable output between versions.**

## Input

  * `n`: the number of nodes
  * `p`: the probability of an edge.
  * `d`: the average degree

## Functions

  * `erdos_renyi_directed(n::Int,p::Float64)` specify the probability (p < 1.) or the average degree (p >= 1.)
  * `erdos_renyi_directed(n::Int,d::Int)` specify the average degree directly

## Output

  * A matrix network type for the Erdős-Rényi graph.
