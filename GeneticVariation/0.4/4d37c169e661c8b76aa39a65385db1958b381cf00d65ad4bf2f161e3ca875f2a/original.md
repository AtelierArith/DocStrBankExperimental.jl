Proportion{T} is a distance which is the count of the mutations of type T that exist between the two biological sequences, divided by the number of valid sites examined (sites which don't have gap or ambiguous symbols). In other words this so called p-distance is simply the proportion of sites between each pair of sequences, that are mutated (again where T determines what kind of mutation).
