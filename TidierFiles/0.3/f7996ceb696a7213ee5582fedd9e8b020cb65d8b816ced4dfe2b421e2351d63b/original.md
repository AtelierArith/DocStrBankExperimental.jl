```
write_table(x, file; delim = '	', na, append, col_names, eol, num_threads)
```

Write a DataFrame to a file, allowing for customization of the delimiter and other options.

# Arguments

  * `x`: The DataFrame to write to a file.
  * `file`: The path to the file where the DataFrame will be written.

-delim: Character to use as the field delimiter. The default is tab ('	'), making it a TSV (tab-separated values) file by default, but can be changed to accommodate other formats.

  * `missing_value`: The string to represent missing data in the output file.
  * `append`: Whether to append to the file if it already exists. If false, the file will be overwritten.
  * `col_names`: Whether to write column names as the first line of the file. If appending to an existing file with append = true, column names will not be written regardless of this parameter's value.
  * `eol`: The end-of-line character to use in the file. Defaults to "

".

  * `num_threads`: Number of threads to use for writing the file. Uses the number of available Julia threads by default.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> df = DataFrame(ID = 1:5, Name = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eva"], Score = [88, 92, 77, 85, 95]);

julia> write_table(df, "tabletest.txt");
```
