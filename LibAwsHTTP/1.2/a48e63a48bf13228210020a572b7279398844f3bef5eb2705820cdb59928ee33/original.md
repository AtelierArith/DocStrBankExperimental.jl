Called repeatedly as payload data arrives. Invoked 0 or more times on the websocket's event-loop thread. Payload data will not be valid after this call, so copy if necessary. The payload data is always unmasked at this point.

NOTE: If you created the websocket with `manual_window_management` set true, you must maintain the read window. Whenever the read window reaches 0, you will stop receiving anything. The websocket's `initial_window_size` determines the starting size of the read window. The read window shrinks as you receive the payload from "data" frames (TEXT, BINARY, and CONTINUATION). Use [`aws_websocket_increment_read_window`](@ref)() to increment the window again and keep frames flowing. Maintain a larger window to keep up high throughput. You only need to worry about the payload from "data" frames. The websocket automatically increments the window to account for any other incoming bytes, including other parts of a frame (opcode, payload-length, etc) and the payload of other frame types (PING, PONG, CLOSE).

Return true to proceed normally. If false is returned, the websocket will read no further data, the frame will complete with an error-code, and the connection will close.
