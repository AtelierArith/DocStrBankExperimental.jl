Invoked when the HTTP/2 settings change is complete. If connection setup successfully this will always be invoked whether settings change successfully or unsuccessfully. If error_code is AWS_ERROR_SUCCESS (0), then the peer has acknowledged the settings and the change has been applied. If error_code is non-zero, then a connection error occurred before the settings could be fully acknowledged and applied. This is always invoked on the connection's event-loop thread.
