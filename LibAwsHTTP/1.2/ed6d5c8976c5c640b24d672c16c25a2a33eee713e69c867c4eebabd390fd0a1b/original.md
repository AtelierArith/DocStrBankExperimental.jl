A function that may modify a request or response before it is sent. The transformation may be asynchronous or immediate. The user MUST invoke the `complete_fn` when transformation is complete or the application will soft-lock. When invoking the `complete_fn`, pass along the `message` and `complete_ctx` provided here and an error code. The error code should be AWS_ERROR_SUCCESS if transformation was successful, otherwise pass a different AWS_ERROR_X value.
