Always invoked asynchronously when the stream was created, successfully or not. When stream is NULL, error code will be set to indicate what happened. If there is a stream returned, you own the stream completely. Invoked on the same thread as other callback of the stream, which will be the thread of the connection, ideally. If there is no connection made, the callback will be invoked from a sperate thread.
