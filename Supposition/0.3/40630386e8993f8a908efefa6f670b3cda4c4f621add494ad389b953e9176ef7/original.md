```
Supposition.jl
```

Supposition.jl is a fuzzing & property based testing (PBT) framework, integrating nicely with `Test.@testset`. Under the hood it's similar to the Python fuzzing framework Hypothesis.

The package features:

  * Generation of (almost) arbitrary instances of types
  * Minimization of failure cases
  * Testing of statemachines
  * Deterministic replaying of failures cases

..and a bunch more! Please check out [the documentation](https://seelengrab.github.io/Supposition.jl/stable/) for more information.
