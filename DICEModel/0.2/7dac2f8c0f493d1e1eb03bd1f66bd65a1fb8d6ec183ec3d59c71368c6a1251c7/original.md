DICEModel

Implementation of the DICE/RICE models

# Notes:

  * Optimization based on DICE2023-b-4-3-10.gms and included files (Nonco2-b-4-3-1.gms and FAIR-beta-4-3-1.gms)
  * Variable casing has been harmonized that all parameters and post-optimization computation have lower cases, and all optimization variables have upper case.
  * DICE has been generalized to work with multiple regions, and it is present in particular a version that uses the structure of DICE 2023 and the regional distribution of initial values (production, emissions, capital, population...) of RICE2020.
