Ocean rectilinear grid. Here I use the slightly abuse the term rectilinear, because the grid supposedly represents layers around the (curved) globe. Here "rectilinear" means that the grid is defined entirely by just its `lat`, `lon`, `depth`, `δlat`, `δlon`, and `δdepth` vectors. For example, the Ocean Circulation Inverse Model (OCIM) version 1 grid is rectilinear in that sense.
