IdealGlmMhdEquations1D(gamma)
```

The ideal compressible GLM-MHD equations for an ideal gas with ratio of specific heats `gamma` in one space dimension.

!!! note
    There is no divergence cleaning variable `psi` because the divergence-free constraint is satisfied trivially in one spatial dimension.
