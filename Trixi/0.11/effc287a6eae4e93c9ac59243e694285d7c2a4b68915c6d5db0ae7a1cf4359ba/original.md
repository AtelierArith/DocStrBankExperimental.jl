A particular type of hydrostatic reconstruction on the water height to guarantee well-balancedness for a general bottom topography [`ShallowWaterEquations1D`](@ref). The reconstructed solution states `u_ll_star` and `u_rr_star` variables are then used to evaluate the surface numerical flux at the interface. Use in combination with the generic numerical flux routine [`FluxHydrostaticReconstruction`](@ref).

Further details on this hydrostatic reconstruction and its motivation can be found in
