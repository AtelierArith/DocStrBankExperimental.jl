Non-symmetric two-point surface flux that discretizes the nonconservative (source) term. The discretization uses the `hydrostatic_reconstruction_audusse_etal` on the conservative variables.

This hydrostatic reconstruction ensures that the finite volume numerical fluxes remain well-balanced for discontinuous bottom topographies [`ShallowWaterEquations1D`](@ref). Should be used together with [`FluxHydrostaticReconstruction`](@ref) and [`hydrostatic_reconstruction_audusse_etal`](@ref) in the surface flux to ensure consistency.

Further details on the hydrostatic reconstruction and its motivation can be found in
