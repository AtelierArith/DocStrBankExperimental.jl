Trixi

**Trixi.jl** is a numerical simulation framework for hyperbolic conservation laws. A key objective for the framework is to be useful to both scientists and students. Therefore, next to having an extensible design with a fast implementation, Trixi.jl is focused on being easy to use for new or inexperienced users, including the installation and postprocessing procedures.

To get started, run your first simulation with Trixi.jl using

```
trixi_include(default_example())
```
