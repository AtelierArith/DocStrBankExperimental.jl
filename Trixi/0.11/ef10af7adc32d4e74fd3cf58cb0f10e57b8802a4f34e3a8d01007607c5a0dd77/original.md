The minimum dissipation local DG (LDG) flux from "An Analysis of the Minimal Dissipation Local  Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Convection–Diffusion Problems" by Cockburn and Dong (2007).  This scheme corresponds to an LDG parabolic "upwinding/downwinding" but no LDG penalty parameter.  Cockburn and Dong proved that this scheme is still stable despite the zero penalty parameter.
