```julia
mutable struct FlowSolver
```

Stores all data that is static throughout iteration of the interior-point method. Is supposed to be generated by corresponding constructor.

# Fields

  * `mesh::MinFEM.Mesh`: Meshed computational domain
  * `inflow_boundary::Set{Int64}`: Inflow boundary with prescribed Dirichlet velocity
  * `noslip_boundary::Set{Int64}`: No-slip boundary with prescribed Dirichlet values
  * `inflow::Vector{Float64}`: Inflow velocity function
  * `verbose::Bool`: Switch for writing output during solve
  * `solve::Function`: Flow solution routine inherently determining the flow type
  * `v::Union{Missing, Vector{Float64}}`: Resulting velocity field
  * `p::Union{Missing, Vector{Float64}}`: Resulting pressure
  * `time::Union{Missing, Float64}`: Required solution time also validating if a result is present
