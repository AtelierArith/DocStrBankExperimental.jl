Evaluate the volume Jacobian.

For the two-dimensional cell,  the volume Jacobian is (i) the product of the surface Jacobian and the other dimension (units of length); or,  when used as axially symmetric (ii) the product of the surface Jacobian and the circumference of the circle through the point `loc` (units of length).

  * `J` = Jacobian matrix
  * `loc` = location of the quadrature point in physical coordinates,
  * `conn` = connectivity of the element,
  * `N` = matrix of basis function values at the quadrature point.
