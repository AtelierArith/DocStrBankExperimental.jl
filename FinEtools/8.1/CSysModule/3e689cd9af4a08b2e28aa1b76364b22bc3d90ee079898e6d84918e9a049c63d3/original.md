Update the coordinate system orientation matrix.

The  coordinate system matrix is updated based upon the location `XYZ` of the evaluation point, and possibly on the Jacobian matrix `tangents` within the element in which the coordinate system matrix is evaluated,  or perhaps on the identifier `feid` of the finite element and/or the quadrature point identifier.

After this function returns, the coordinate system matrix can be read in the buffer as `self.csmat`.
