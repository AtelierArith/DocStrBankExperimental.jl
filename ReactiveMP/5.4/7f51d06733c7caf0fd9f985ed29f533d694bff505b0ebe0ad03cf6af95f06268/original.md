The RadialFlow function is defined as

$$
f({\bf{x}}) = {\bf{x}} + \frac{\beta({bf{z}} - {\bf{z}}_0)}{\alpha + |{\bf{z}} - {\bf{z}}_0|}
$$

with input and output dimension $D$. Here ${\bf{x}}\in \mathbb{R}^D$ represents the input of the function. Furthermore ${\bf{z}}_0\in \mathbb{R}^D$, $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$ and $\beta\in\mathbb{R}$ represent the parameters of the function. The function contracts and expands the input space. 

This function has been introduced in:
