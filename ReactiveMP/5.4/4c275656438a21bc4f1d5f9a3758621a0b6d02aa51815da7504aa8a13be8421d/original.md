`ContinuousTransitionMeta` is used as a metadata flag in `ContinuousTransition` to define the transformation function for constructing the matrix `A` from vector `a`.

`ContinuousTransitionMeta` requires a transformation function and the length of vector `a`, which acts as an expansion point for approximating the transformation linearly. If transformation appears to be linear, then no approximation is performed.

Constructors:

  * `ContinuousTransitionMeta(transformation::Function, aÌ‚::Vector{<:Real})`: Constructs a `ContinuousTransitionMeta` struct with the transformation function and allocated basis vectors.

Fields:

  * `f`:  Represents the transformation function that transforms vector `a` into matrix `A`

The `ContinuousTransitionMeta` struct plays a pivotal role in defining how the vector `a` is transformed into the matrix `A`, thus influencing the behavior of the `ContinuousTransition` node.
