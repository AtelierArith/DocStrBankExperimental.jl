The CompiledFlowModel structure is the most generic type of compiled Flow model, in which the layers are not constrained to be of a specific type. The FlowModel structure contains the input dimension and a tuple of compiled layers. Do not manually create a CompiledFlowModel! Instead create a FlowModel first and compile it with `compile(model::FlowModel)`. This will make sure that all layers/mappings are configured with the proper dimensionality and with randomly sampled parameters. Alternatively, if you would like to pass your own parameters, call `compile(model::FlowModel, params::Vector)`.

Note: this model can be specialized by constraining the types of layers. This potentially allows for more efficient specialized methods that can deal with specifics of these layers, such as triangular jacobian matrices.
