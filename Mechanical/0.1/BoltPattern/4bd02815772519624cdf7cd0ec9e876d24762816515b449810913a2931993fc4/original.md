```
plot_bolt_pattern(points; A = 1, udf_pivot = false)
```

Plot bolt pattern and centroid.

`points` is a tuple of x & y coordinates ([x], [y]).  The `points` may be generated by functions [`circle`](@ref) and [`rectangle`](@ref). `A` is the bolt stress area, either entered as a single value for all bolts or different values for each bolt (i.e. vector). `udf_pivot` is false when it is to be calculated, or enetered as [x,y] when a specific pivot point is desired to be manually entered. Units  conforming to the `Unitful` package should be applied.
