```
plot_bolt_loads(points; Fc=[0,0,0]N, Mc = [0,0,0]N*m, A=1mm^2, udf_pivot=false, length_format = "mm", load_format = "kN")
```

Plot the bolt loads for the forces and moments acting about the centroid of the bolt pattern.

```
`points` is a tuple of x & y coordinates ([x], [y]).  The `points` may be generated by functions [`circle`](@ref) and [`rectangle`](@ref).
`Fc` is the force acting at the centroid of the bolt pattern entered as a vector [Fxc, Fyc, Fzc]. 
`Mc` is the moment acting at the centroid of the bolt pattern entered as a vector [Mxc, Myc, Mzc].
`udf_pivot` is false when it is to be calculated, or enetered as [x,y] when a specific pivot point is desired to be manually entered.
`A` is the bolt stress area, either entered as a single value for all bolts or different values for each bolt (i.e. vector).
`length_format` may be 'mm', `cm`, 'm` or `inch`, and sets the display output returned.
`load_format` may by 'N', 'kN', or `lbf`, and sets the display output returned.
Units conforming to the `Unitful` package should be applied.
