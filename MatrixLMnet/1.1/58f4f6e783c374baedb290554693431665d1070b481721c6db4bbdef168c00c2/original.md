Performs coordinate descent using either random or cyclic updates. Does NOT  take advantage of the active set; see `cd_active!`. 

# Arguments

  * X = 2d array of floats consisting of the row covariates, with all  categorical variables coded in appropriate contrasts
  * Y = 2d array of floats consisting of the multivariate response
  * Z = 2d array of floats consisting of the column covariates, with all  categorical variables coded in appropriate contrasts
  * lambda = lambda penalty, a floating scalar
  * alpha = parameter (Ïµ[0, 1]) determining the mix of penalties between L1 and L2
  * B = 2d array of floats consisting of starting coefficient estimates
  * regXidx = 1d array of indices corresponding to regularized X covariates
  * regZidx = 1d array of indices corresponding to regularized Z covariates
  * reg = 2d array of bits, indicating whether or not to regularize each of the  coefficients
  * norms = 2d array of floats consisting of the norms corresponding to each  coefficient or `nothing`

# Keyword arguments

  * isVerbose = boolean flag indicating whether or not to print messages.   Defaults to `true`.
  * stepsize = float; step size for updates  (irrelevant for coordinate descent). Defaults to `0.01`.
  * isRandom = boolean flag indicating whether to use random or cyclic updates.  Defaults to `true`.
  * thresh = threshold at which the coefficients are considered to have  converged, a floating scalar. Defaults to `10^(-7)`.
  * maxiter = maximum number of update iterations. Defaults to `10^10`.

# Value

None; updates coefficients in place

# Some notes

Convergence is determined as when the log ratio of the current and previous  criteria is less than the threshold `thresh`.
