Performs the Elastic-net version ISTA with fixed step size.

# Arguments

  * X = 2d array of floats consisting of the row covariates, with all  categorical variables coded in appropriate contrasts
  * Y = 2d array of floats consisting of the multivariate response
  * Z = 2d array of floats consisting of the column covariates, with all  categorical variables coded in appropriate contrasts
  * lambda = penalty parameter, a floating scalar
  * alpha = parameter (Ïµ[0, 1]) determining the mix of penalties between L1 and L2
  * B = 2d array of floats consisting of starting coefficient estimates
  * regXidx = 1d array of indices corresponding to regularized X covariates
  * regZidx = 1d array of indices corresponding to regularized Z covariates
  * reg = 2d array of bits, indicating whether or not to regularize each of the  coefficients
  * norms = 2d array of floats consisting of the norms corresponding to each  coefficient or `nothing`

# Keyword arguments

  * isVerbose = boolean flag indicating whether or not to print messages.   Defaults to `true`.
  * stepsize = float; step size for updates. Defaults to `0.01`.
  * thresh = threshold at which the coefficients are considered to have  converged, a floating scalar. Defaults to `10^(-7)`.
  * maxiter = maximum number of update iterations. Defaults to `10^10`.

# Value

None; updates coefficients in place

# Some notes

Convergence is determined as when the log ratio of the current and previous  criteria is less than the threshold `thresh`. 

The default method for choosing the fixed step size for `ista!` is to use the  reciprocal of the product of the maximum eigenvalues of `X*transpose(X)`  and `Z*transpose(Z)`. This is computed by the `mlmnet` function when `ista!`  is passed into the `fun` argument and `setStepSize` is set to `true`. If  `setStepSize` is set to `false`, the value of the `stepsize` argument will be  used as the fixed step size. Note that obtaining the eigenvalues when `X`  and/or `Z` are very large may exceed computational limitations.
