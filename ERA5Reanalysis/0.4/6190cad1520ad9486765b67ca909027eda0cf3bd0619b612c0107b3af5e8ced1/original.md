download(
    e5ds :: Union{ERA5Hourly,ERA5Monthly},
    evar :: SingleVariable,
    ereg :: ERA5Region;
    ispy :: Bool = false,
    overwrite :: Bool = false
) -> nothing
```

Downloads ERA5 data from the CDS datastore for a specified Single-Level variable and geographic region.  You can specify to download via python scripts generated by selecting `ispy` to `true`, or to instead use Julia directly.

You must have installed the CDSAPI on your machine and have accepted the terms and conditions on the CDS website in order for this to work.

# Arguments

  * `e5ds` : The ERA5Dataset specified (Hourly or Monthly)

      * `e5ds.start` defines the start date
      * `e5ds.stop` defines the end date
      * `e5ds.path` defines the path to which all reanalysis data is saved
  * `evar` : Specifies the Single-Level variable to be downloaded
  * `ereg` : Specifies the `GeoRegion` and the resolution of the data to be downloaded
  * `ipsy` : Specifies whether to generate a python script that can be used to download the data instead of Julia
  * `overwrite` : `false` by default. If set to true, existing data will be overwritten.
