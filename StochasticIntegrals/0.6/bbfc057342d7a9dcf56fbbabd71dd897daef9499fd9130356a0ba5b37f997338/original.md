Creates an ItoSet. This contains :

  * A correlation matrix of brownian motions.
  * A vector giving the axis labels for this correlation matrix.
  * A dict of `ItoInteral`s. Here the keys should be ids for the ito integrals and the values should be `ItoIntegral`s.

Determine which Brownian processes are used in an array of `ItoIntegral`s.
