```
Grid(searchspace; npartitions)
```

Return an iterator over the given searchspace.

The `npartitions` controls the number of partitions for each axis when `searchspace isa BoxConstrainedSpace` (3 by default).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> for x in Grid(PermutationSpace([:red, :green, :blue]))
           @show x
       end
x = [:red, :green, :blue]
x = [:red, :blue, :green]
x = [:green, :red, :blue]
x = [:green, :blue, :red]
x = [:blue, :red, :green]
x = [:blue, :green, :red]

julia> for x in Grid(BoxConstrainedSpace(lb=[-1.0, -1], ub=[1, 0.0]), npartitions=3)
           @show x
       end
x = [-1.0, -1.0]
x = [0.0, -1.0]
x = [1.0, -1.0]
x = [-1.0, -0.5]
x = [0.0, -0.5]
x = [1.0, -0.5]
x = [-1.0, 0.0]
x = [0.0, 0.0]
x = [1.0, 0.0]
