```
feed!(turtle::Turtle; mesh::Mesh; kwargs...)
```

General purpose method to feed a mesh to a turtle together with color and material. Note that all primitives provided by VPL are implemented as meshes, but this is a generic method for meshes that are constructed directly by the user or imported from external software.
