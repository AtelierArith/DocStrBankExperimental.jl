```
Turtle(Float64, message)
```

Create a meshing turtle that can convert a `Graph` into a 3D mesh using turtle operators, geometry primitives and methods of `feed!()`. By default, the meshing turtle will generate geometry primitives with double floating precision (`Float64`) but it is possible to generate a version with lower precision as in `Turtle(Float32)`. The argument `message` is any user-defined object.
