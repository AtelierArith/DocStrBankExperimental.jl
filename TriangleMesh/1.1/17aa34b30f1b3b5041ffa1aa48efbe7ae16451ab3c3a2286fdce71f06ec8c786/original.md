```
create_mesh(poly :: Polygon_pslg, switches :: String; info_str :: String = "Triangular mesh of polygon (PSLG)")
```

Creates a triangulation of a planar straight-line graph (PSLG) polygon.  Options for the meshing algorithm are passed directly by command line switches for Triangle. Use only if you know what you are doing.
