struct ConcentratedLoad
```

A type representing a concentrated load in the finite element model.

  * `ID`: Identification tag of the node at which the concentrated load is applied
  * `F_x`: Concentrated load in the global $x$-direction
  * `F_y`: Concentrated load in the global $y$-direction
  * `F_z`: Concentrated load in the global $z$-direction
  * `M_x`: Moment about the global $x$-axis
  * `M_y`: Moment about the global $y$-axis
  * `M_z`: Moment about the global $z$-axis
