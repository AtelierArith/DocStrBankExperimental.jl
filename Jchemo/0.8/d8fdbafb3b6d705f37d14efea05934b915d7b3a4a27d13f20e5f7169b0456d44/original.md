frob2(X)
frob2(X, weights::Weight)
```

Frobenius norm of a matrix.

  * `X` : A matrix (n, p).
  * `weights` : Weights (n) of the observations. Object of type    `Weight` (e.g. generated by function `mweight`).

The Frobenius norm of `X` is:

  * sqrt(tr(X' * X)).

The Frobenius weighted norm is:

  * sqrt(tr(X' * D * X)), where D is the diagonal matrix of vector `w`.

Functions `frob2` are the squared versions of `frob`.
