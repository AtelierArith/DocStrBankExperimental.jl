Averaging kNN-LWPLSR models with different numbers of latent variables (kNN-LWPLSR-AVG).

  * `X` : X-data (n, p).
  * `Y` : Y-data (n, q).

Keyword arguments:

  * `nlvdis` : Number of latent variables (LVs) to consider in the global PLS used for the dimension    reduction before computing the dissimilarities. If `nlvdis = 0`, there is no dimension reduction.   If `nlvdis = 0`, there is no dimension reduction.
  * `metric` : Type of dissimilarity used to select the neighbors and to compute the weights    (see function `getknn`). Possible values are: `:eucl` (Euclidean), `:mah` (Mahalanobis),    `:sam` (spectral angular distance), `:cor` (correlation distance).
  * `h` : A scalar defining the shape of the weight function computed by function `winvs`. Lower is h,    sharper is the function. See function `winvs` for details (keyword arguments `criw` and `squared` of    `winvs` can also be specified here).
  * `k` : The number of nearest neighbors to select for each observation to predict.
  * `tolw` : For stabilization when very close neighbors.
  * `nlv` : A range of nb. of latent variables (LVs)    to compute for the local (i.e. inside each neighborhood)    models.
  * `scal` : Boolean. If `true`, (a) each column of the global `X`    (and of the global `Y` if there is a preliminary PLS reduction dimension)    is scaled by its uncorrected standard deviation before to compute    the distances and the weights, and (b) the X and Y scaling is also done    within each neighborhood (local level) for the weighted PLSR.
  * `verbose` : Boolean. If `true`, predicting information are printed.

Ensemblist method where the predictions are computed by averaging the predictions of a set of  models built with different numbers of LVs, such as in Lesnoff 2023. On each neighborhood, a  PLSR-averaging (Lesnoff et al. 2022) is done instead of a PLSR.

For instance, if argument `nlv` is set to `nlv` = `5:10`, the prediction for a new observation is the  simple average of the predictions returned by the models with 5 LVs, 6 LVs, ... 10 LVs, respectively.
