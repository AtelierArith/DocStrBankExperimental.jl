```
covm(X)
covm(X, weights::Weight)
covm(X, Y) 
covm(X, Y, weights::Weight)
```

Compute a weighted covariance matrix.

  * `X` : Data (n, p).
  * `Y` : Data (n, q).
  * `weights` : Weights (n) of the observations. Object of type    `Weight` (e.g. generated by function `mweight`).

The function computes the uncorrected covariance matrix: 

  * of the columns of `X`:  ==> (p, p) matrix
  * or between columns of `X` and `Y` :  ==> (p, q) matrix.

## Examples

```julia
using Jchemo

n, p = 5, 6
X = rand(n, p)
Y = rand(n, 3)
w = mweight(rand(n))

covm(X, w)
covm(X, Y, w)
```
