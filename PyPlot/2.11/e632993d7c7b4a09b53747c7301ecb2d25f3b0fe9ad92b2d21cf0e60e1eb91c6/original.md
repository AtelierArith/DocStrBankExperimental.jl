```
using3D()
```

This function ensures that the `mplot3d` module is loaded for 3d plotting.   This occurs automatically if you call any of the 3d plotting functions like `plot3D` or `surf`, but it may be necessary to call this function manually if you are passing `projection="3d"` explicitly to axes or subplot objects.
