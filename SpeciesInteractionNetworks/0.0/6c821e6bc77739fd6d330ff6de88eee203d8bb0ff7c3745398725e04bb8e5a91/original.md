ClosenessCentrality
```

Closeness centrality is defined as the reciprocal of farness, *i.e.* 1 over the sum of shortest paths from the source node to all other nodes. In the case of probabilistic networks, we use the random walk approximation of closeness centrality, where the distance is defined as first passage time.
