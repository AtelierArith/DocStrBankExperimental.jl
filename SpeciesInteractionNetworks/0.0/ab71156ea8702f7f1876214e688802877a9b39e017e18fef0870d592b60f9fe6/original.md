```
Partiteness{T}
```

The species in a network are stored in a parametric sub-type of `Partiteness`. By default, this can be `Unipartite` or `Bipartite`. The inner type `T` indicates what types can be used to represent species. Note that species *cannot* be represented as integers, and will instead have a name. We recommend using strings or symbols.
