MolecularProperty("Name")
```

Convenience constructor that looks up molecular properties from a table in `tabulated_properties`.

The properties are taken from the wonderful MIT-licensed [CoolProp](http://coolprop.org). Please note that the equations of state included in this module may not be appropriate for all the available species included in CoolProp, especially for mixtures!

See list of species [at CoolProp website](http://coolprop.org/fluid_properties/PurePseudoPure.html#list-of-fluids).
