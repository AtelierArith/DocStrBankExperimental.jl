SSP333(; β = 1/2 + √3/6)
```

Family of IMEX SSPRK algorithms parametrized by the value β from [CGGS2017](@cite), Section 3.2, with 3 implicit stages, 3 explicit stages, and 3rd order accuracy. The default value of β results in an SDIRK algorithm, which is also called *SSP3(333)c* in [GGHRUW2018](@cite).
