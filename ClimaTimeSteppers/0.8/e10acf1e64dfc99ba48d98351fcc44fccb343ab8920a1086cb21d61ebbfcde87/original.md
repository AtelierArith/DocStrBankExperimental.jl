ForwardDiffStepSize3()
```

A `ForwardDiffStepSize` that is described in the paper "Jacobian-free Newtonâ€“Krylov methods: a survey of approaches and applications" by D.A. Knoll and D.E. Keyes. According to the paper, this is the average step size one gets when using a certain forward difference approximation for each Jacobian element.
