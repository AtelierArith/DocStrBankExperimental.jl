Demmler-Reinsch orthogonalization for fast ridge regressions with alternative smoothing parameters. The implementation follows Ruppert et al. (2003).

Once the orthogonalization is solved, estimates with different smoothing parameters can be generated at very low cost. The resulting estimates are accurate enough for model selection and are typically very close to the estimates generated by the slower [`DirectSolve`](@ref) approach that directly solves the penalized least squares problem for each parameter.
