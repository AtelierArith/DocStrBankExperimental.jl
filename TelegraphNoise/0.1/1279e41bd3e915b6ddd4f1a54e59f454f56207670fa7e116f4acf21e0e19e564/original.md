# Random Telegraph Noise (RTN)

RTN is a type of random signal with two states, on or off, up or down, *etc.* with a mean *dwell time* $T_D$ which characterizes the amount of time the signal spends in each state  before switching.

This module provides an easy framework to generate such signals, as they happen to have  well known analytical properties. For example, the autocovariance of the signal (often  called the *autocorrelation* in physics literature) goes as 

$$
\mathcal{A}(t, t_0; T_D) = \exp\left( -2\,\frac{\vert t - t_0 \vert}{T_D} \right). 
$$

Therefore, the characteristic *autocorrelation time* $\tau = T_D/2$. Importantly, the  expression above shows that these random signals are *stationary* meaning that correlations are time-translation invariant. This means a random telgraph signal is well-suited for testing autocorrelations of random signals, for example those generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo  methods.
