Generate a random number of steps in which to stay in the next state.

# Additional information

The probability that an RTN signal will *dwell* in its current state for a time $t \in (t_0, t_0 + {\rm d} t)$ is given by 

$$
{\rm Pr}\left( t \in (t_0, t_0 + {\rm d} t) \right) = {\rm e}^{-t/T_D} \cdot \frac{{\rm d}t}{T_D}.
$$

One then samples from this probability distribution using the *inverse-CDF* method and obtains

$$
t \approx {\rm floor} \left[ -T_D \ln \left( 1 - u \right)  \right],
$$

with $u \in (0, 1)$ being a uniform random `Float` generated by `rand()`. The approximation  is necessary as $t$ represents a discrete time in a time series.
