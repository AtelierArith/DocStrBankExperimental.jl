`coefficients(p::Mvp, var::Symbol)` 

returns  a Dict with keys the degree  in `var` and values the corresponding coefficient of `p` with respect to `var`.

```julia-repl
julia> p=(x+y+inv(y))^4
Mvp{Int64}: x⁴+4x³y+4x³y⁻¹+6x²y²+12x²+6x²y⁻²+4xy³+12xy+12xy⁻¹+4xy⁻³+y⁴+4y²+6+4y⁻²+y⁻⁴

julia> coefficients(p,:x)
Dict{Int64, Mvp{Int64, Int64}} with 5 entries:
  0 => y⁴+4y²+6+4y⁻²+y⁻⁴
  4 => 1
  2 => 6y²+12+6y⁻²
  3 => 4y+4y⁻¹
  1 => 4y³+12y+12y⁻¹+4y⁻³

julia> coefficients(p,:y)
Dict{Int64, Mvp{Int64, Int64}} with 9 entries:
  0  => x⁴+12x²+6
  4  => 1
  -1 => 4x³+12x
  2  => 6x²+4
  -3 => 4x
  -2 => 6x²+4
  -4 => 1
  3  => 4x
  1  => 4x³+12x
```

The  same  caveat  is  applicable  to  `coefficients` as to evaluating: the values  are always `Mvp`s. To get a list of scalars for the coefficients of a  univariate polynomial represented as a `Mvp`, one should use `scalar` on the values of `coefficients`.
