Initial step size algorithm from   W. W. Hager and H. Zhang (2006) Algorithm 851: CG_DESCENT, a     conjugate gradient method with guaranteed descent. ACM     Transactions on Mathematical Software 32: 113–137.

If α0 is NaN, then procedure I0 is called at the first iteration, otherwise, we select according to procedure I1-2, with starting value α0.
