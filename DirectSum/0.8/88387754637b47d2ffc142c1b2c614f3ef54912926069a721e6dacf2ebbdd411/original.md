```
@mixedbasis
```

Generates `Submanifold` elements having `Manifold` specified by `V⊕V'`. As a result of this macro, all of the `Submanifold{V⊕V',G}` elements generated by that `TensorBundle` become available in the local workspace with the specified naming. The first argument provides pseudoscalar specifications, the second argument is the variable name for the `Manifold`, and the third and fourth argument are variable prefixes of the `Submanifold` vector names (and covector basis names). Default for `@mixedbasis M` is `@mixedbasis M V v w ∂ ϵ`.
