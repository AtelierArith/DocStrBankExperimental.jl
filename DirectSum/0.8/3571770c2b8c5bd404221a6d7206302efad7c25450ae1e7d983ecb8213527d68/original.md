```
@dualbasis
```

Generates `Submanifold` elements having `Manifold` specified by `V'`. As a result of this macro, all of the `Submanifold{V',G}` elements generated by that `TensorBundle` become available in the local workspace with the specified naming. The first argument provides pseudoscalar specifications, the second argument is the variable name for the dual `Manifold`, and the third and fourth argument are variable prefixes of the `Submanifold` covector names (and tensor field basis names). Default for `@dualbasis M` is `@dualbasis M VV w Ïµ`.
