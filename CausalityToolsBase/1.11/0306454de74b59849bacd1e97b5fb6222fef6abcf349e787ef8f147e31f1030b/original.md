RefinedTriangulationBinningSplitFactor
```

A binning scheme for a triangulated simplex partition where some simplices have been  refined (subdivided by a shape-preserving simplex subdivision algorithm).

The split factor bound controls how many times each simplex of the initial triangulation  is to be split.

## Fields

  * **`simplex_split_factor::Int`**: The number of times each simplex is split.
