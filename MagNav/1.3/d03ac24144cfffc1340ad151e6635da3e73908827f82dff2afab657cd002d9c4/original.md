Enhanced Magnetic Model (EMM). Compiled from satellite, marine, airborne, and ground magnetic measurements. Expands the scalar crustal field up to spherical harmonic degree and order 720, providing a vector of the magnetic field with approximately 15 arcminute resolution. Underlying crustal field model derived from Earth Magnetic Anomaly Grid with 2-arc-minute resolution (EMAG2). Reference: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/enhanced-magnetic-model
