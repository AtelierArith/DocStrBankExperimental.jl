Store key elements of the primal-dual KKT system for a MCP composed of functions G(.) and H(.) such that                              0 = G(x, y; θ)                              0 ≤ H(x, y; θ) ⟂ y ≥ 0.

The primal-dual system arises when we introduce slack variable `s` and set                              G(x, y; θ)     = 0                              H(x, y; θ) - s = 0                              s ⦿ y - ϵ      = 0 for some ϵ > 0. Define the function `F(x, y, s; θ, ϵ)` to return the left hand side of this system of equations.
