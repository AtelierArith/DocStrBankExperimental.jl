```
Circuit(q3d_file; matrix_types = [:capacitance])
```

Return an `AdmittanceModels.Circuit` from a plain text file generated by ANSYS Q3D containing RLGC simulation output.

# Args

  * `q3d_file`: the path to the text file.
  * `matrix_type`: A list of symbols indicating which type of matrix data to read. Currently, symbols in [:capacitance, :conductance] are the only available choices, and only the units in ["pF", "nF", "mF", "uF", "fF", "farad", "sie", "mSie"] are handled.
