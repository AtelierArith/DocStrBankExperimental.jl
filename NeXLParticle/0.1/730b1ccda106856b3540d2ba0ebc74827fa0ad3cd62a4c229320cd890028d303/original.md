A Blob is a mask consisting of blocks of adjacent pixels meeting a threshold. Only those pixels immediately above, below, left or right are considered to be adjacent (not diagonals).  Blobs offer easy access to a mask consisting of pixels in the blob and the perimeter either as a list of steps from one perimeter point to the next or a list of CartesianIndex with the coordinates of the perimeter points.
