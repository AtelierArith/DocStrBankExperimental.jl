Clusters N-dimensional data using an algorithm based on a N-dimensional histogram.  The data is summarized in an N-dimensional histogram.  The bins are sorted according to population count.  Starting with the most populous bin, adjacent bins are joined into islands according to the following rules.  If a bin is adjacent to one island then the bin is added to the island.  If the bin is adjacent to two islands and it's population exceeds a threshold of the highest bin in each island, then the islands are joined together into a larger island.  If the bin height is less than the threshold, the bin is added to the less island with the smaller highest bin.  So constructed, each island represents a cluster.  The clusters are assigned integer indexes starting at 1 and cluster assignments for each pixel are written to an `Array`.

This algorithm is best for data like compositional data which is naturally normalized to a unity sum and for which each layer in the data is on an equivalent scale.  The algorithm can be extended to work with other data types or the data can be preprocessed to bring it onto an equivalent scale.
