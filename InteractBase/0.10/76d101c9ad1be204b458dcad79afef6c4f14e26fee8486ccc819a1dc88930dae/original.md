`accordion(options; multiple = true)`

Display `options` in an `accordion` menu. `options` is an `AbstractDict` whose keys represent the labels and whose values represent what is shown in each entry.

`options` can be an `Observable`, in which case the `accordion` updates as soon as `options` changes.
