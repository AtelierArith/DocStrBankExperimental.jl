`alert(text="")`

Creates a `Widget{:alert}`. To cause it to trigger an alert, do:

```julia
wdg = alert("Error!")
wdg()
```

Calling `wdg` with a string will set the alert message to that string before triggering the alert:

```julia
wdg = alert("Error!")
wdg("New error message!")
```

For the javascript to work, the widget needs to be part of the UI, even though it is not visible.
