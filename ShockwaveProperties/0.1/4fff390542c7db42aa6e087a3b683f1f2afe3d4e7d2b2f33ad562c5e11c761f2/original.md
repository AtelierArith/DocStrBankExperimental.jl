ConservedState{<:Density, <:MomentumDensity, <:EnergyDensity}
```

The conserved quantities in the Euler equations.

  * $ρ$: Density of the gas.
  * $ρv$: Momentum density of the gas, represented as a vector quantity.
  * $ρE$: The **sum** of the internal energy density of the gas and kinetic energy density of the moving gas.
