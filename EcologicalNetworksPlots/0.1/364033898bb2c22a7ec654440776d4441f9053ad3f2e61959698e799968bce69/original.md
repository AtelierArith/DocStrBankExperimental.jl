```
NestedBipartiteLayout
```

Parameters are

  * `align` (whether the two levels should be centered together)
  * `relative` (whether the two levels should occupy a length equal to their relative richness)
  * `spread` (the distance between the two)

Note that to see the effect of `spread`, you may have to use `aspectratio=1`; if not, the spacing between levels will be determined by the dimensions of the plot.
