```
position!(LA::CircularLayout, L::Dict{K,NodePosition}, N::T) where {T <: AbstractEcologicalNetwork} where {K}
```

Nodes will be positioned at equal distances along a circle, and nodes that are densely connected will be closer to one another. This is an efficient way to represent modular networks.
