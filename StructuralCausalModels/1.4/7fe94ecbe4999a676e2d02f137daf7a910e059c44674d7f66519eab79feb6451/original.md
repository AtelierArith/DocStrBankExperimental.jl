# StructuralCausalModels

StructuralCausalModels.jl provides functionality to analyse directed acyclic graph (DAG) based causal models as described in `StatisticalRethinking`, `Causal Inference in Statistics` and `Cause and Correlation in Biology`.

My initial goal for this package is to have a way to apply SCM ideas to the examples in the context of StatisticalRethinking, i.e. a working version of `basis_set()`, `d_separation()`, `m_separation()` and `adjustment_sets()`.

SCM can be used as an alias to StructuralCausalModels.
