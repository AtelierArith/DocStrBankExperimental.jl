**AtiyahBott** is a module containing an implementation of the Atiyah-Bott residue formula in the Julia language. The theory and the algorithm behind the package is described in the paper  "Effective computations of the Atiyah-Bott formula" by Giosu√® Muratore and  Csaba Schneider (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsc.2022.01.005).

A previous version used colorations from here: https://github.com/mgemath/Colorations. The current version generates internally all colorations.
