```
label_voronoi_grid(grid; shuffle_cells=true)
```

Given a grid of un-plottable things, it assigns each unique value in the grid a number to plot. `shuffle_cells` determines whether the assigned values are randomly shuffled before assignment. If they're not you might get a pretty gradient or other pattern :)
