```
draw(P,outeredge,corners)
```

Draw the planar map P with outer face either:     - the face to the left of the `outeredge`     - the face containing the sequence of vertices `corners`

  * `outeredge` is an ordered pair
  * `corners` is either `nothing` (to indicate deference to   specification via `outeredge`) or an ordered triple
