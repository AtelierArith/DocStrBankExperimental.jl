Sellmeier(A, B, p, C, D, q)
```

The [Sellmeier equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sellmeier_equation) are used to describe dispersion in glass using a series of resonances, here generalized to support variations found in the literature:

$$
n^2(\lambda) =
1 + A + \sum_i \frac {B_i\lambda^{p_i}}{\lambda^2-C_i} + \sum_j D_j \lambda^{q_j}.
$$
