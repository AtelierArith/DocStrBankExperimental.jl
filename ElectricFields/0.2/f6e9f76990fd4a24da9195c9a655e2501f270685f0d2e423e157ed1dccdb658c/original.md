free_oscillation_amplitude(F)
```

Compute the free oscillation amplitude of an electric field `F`, i.e. the mean excursion length during one cycle of the field, defined as

$$
\alpha \defd \frac{F}{\omega^2}
$$

where `F` is the peak amplitude, i.e. this is defined for one cycle of a monochrome field.
