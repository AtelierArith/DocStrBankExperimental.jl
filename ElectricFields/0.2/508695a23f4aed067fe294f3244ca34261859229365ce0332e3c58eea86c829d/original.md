The [Keldysh parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_ionization) relates the strength of a dynamic electric field to that of the binding potential of an atom. It is given by

$$
\gamma = \sqrt{\frac{I_p}{2U_p}},
$$

where $I_p$ is the ionization potential of the atom and $U_p$ is the ponderomotive potential of the dynamic field.
