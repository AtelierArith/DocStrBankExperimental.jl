ponderomotive_potential(f)
```

Return the [ponderomotive potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponderomotive_energy) $U_p$, which is the cycle-average quiver energy of a free electron in an electromagnetic field `f`. It is given by

$$
U_p =
\frac{e^2E_0^2}{4m\omega^2}=\frac{2e^2}{c\varepsilon_0m}\times\frac{I}{4\omega^2},
$$

or, in atomic units,

$$
U_p = \frac{I}{4\omega^2}.
$$
