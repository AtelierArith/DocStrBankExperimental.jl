This function is to test a surface reaction mechanism. Ideally the sum of fluxes must vanish at steady state.  The function also gives the surface coverages for a  given gasphase concentration and T,p conditions. The program generates only a screen outout

# Usage:

  * coverage(input*file, lib*dir)
  * input_file: name of the input file (String)
  * lib_dir: path to the folder where the data files are present
