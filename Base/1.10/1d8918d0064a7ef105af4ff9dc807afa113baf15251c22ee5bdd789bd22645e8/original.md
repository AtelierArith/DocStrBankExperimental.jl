```
Dict([itr])
```

`Dict{K,V}()` constructs a hash table with keys of type `K` and values of type `V`. Keys are compared with [`isequal`](@ref) and hashed with [`hash`](@ref).

Given a single iterable argument, constructs a [`Dict`](@ref) whose key-value pairs are taken from 2-tuples `(key,value)` generated by the argument.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Dict([("A", 1), ("B", 2)])
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "B" => 2
  "A" => 1
```

Alternatively, a sequence of pair arguments may be passed.

```jldoctest
julia> Dict("A"=>1, "B"=>2)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "B" => 2
  "A" => 1
```
