simplify
```

SymPy has dozens of functions to perform various kinds of simplification. There is also one general function called `simplify` that attempts to apply all of these functions in an intelligent way to arrive at the simplest form of an expression. (See [Simplification](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/simplification.html) for details on `simplify` and other related functionality). Other simplification functions are available through the `sympy` object.

For non-symbolic expressions, `simplify` returns its first argument.
