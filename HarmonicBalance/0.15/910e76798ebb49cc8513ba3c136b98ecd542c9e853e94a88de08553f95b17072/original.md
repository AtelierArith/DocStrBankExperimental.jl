    order,
    fast_time,
    slow_time
)

```

Apply the Krylov-Bogoliubov averaging method to a specific `order` to obtain a set of ODEs (the slow-flow equations) governing the harmonics of `diff_eom`.

The harmonics evolve in `slow_time`, the oscillating terms themselves in `fast_time`. If no input is used, a variable T is defined for `slow_time` and `fast_time` is taken as the independent variable of `diff_eom`.

Krylov-Bogoliubov averaging method can be applied up to `order = 2`.

# Example

```julia-repl
julia> @variables t, x(t), ω0, ω, F;

# enter the simple harmonic oscillator
julia> diff_eom = DifferentialEquation( d(x,t,2) + ω0^2 * x ~ F *cos(ω*t), x);

# expand x in the harmonic ω
julia> add_harmonic!(diff_eom, x, ω);

# get equations for the harmonics evolving in the slow time T to first order
julia> harmonic_eom = get_krylov_equations(diff_eom, order = 1)

A set of 2 harmonic equations
Variables: u1(T), v1(T)
Parameters: ω, F, ω0

Harmonic ansatz:
xˍt(t) =
x(t) = u1(T)*cos(ωt) + v1(T)*sin(ωt)

Harmonic equations:

((1//2)*(ω^2)*v1(T) - (1//2)*(ω0^2)*v1(T)) / ω ~ Differential(T)(u1(T))

((1//2)*(ω0^2)*u1(T) - (1//2)*F - (1//2)*(ω^2)*u1(T)) / ω ~ Differential(T)(v1(T))
```
