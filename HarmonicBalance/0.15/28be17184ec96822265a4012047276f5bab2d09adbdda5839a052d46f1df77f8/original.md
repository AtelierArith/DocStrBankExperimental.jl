```

Apply the harmonic ansatz, followed by the slow-flow, Fourier transform and dropping higher-order derivatives to obtain a set of ODEs (the harmonic equations) governing the harmonics of `diff_eom`.

The harmonics evolve in `slow_time`, the oscillating terms themselves in `fast_time`. If no input is used, a variable T is defined for `slow_time` and `fast_time` is taken as the independent variable of `diff_eom`.

By default, all products of order > 1 of `slow_time`-derivatives are dropped, which means the equations are linear in the time-derivatives.

# Example

```julia-repl
julia> @variables t, x(t), ω0, ω, F;

# enter the simple harmonic oscillator
julia> diff_eom = DifferentialEquation( d(x,t,2) + ω0^2 * x ~ F *cos(ω*t), x);

# expand x in the harmonic ω
julia> add_harmonic!(diff_eom, x, ω);

# get equations for the harmonics evolving in the slow time T
julia> harmonic_eom = get_harmonic_equations(diff_eom)

A set of 2 harmonic equations
Variables: u1(T), v1(T)
Parameters: ω0, ω, F

Harmonic ansatz:
x(t) = u1*cos(ωt) + v1*sin(ωt)

Harmonic equations:

(ω0^2)*u1(T) + (2//1)*ω*Differential(T)(v1(T)) - (ω^2)*u1(T) ~ F

(ω0^2)*v1(T) - (ω^2)*v1(T) - (2//1)*ω*Differential(T)(u1(T)) ~ 0
