CVaR(α)
```

The conditional value at risk (CV@R) for a random variable Z.

Computes the expectation of the outcomes above the α quantile. α must be in `[0,1]`; if `α=0`, this is equivalent to the Expectation, and if `α=1`, this the Supremum.

CV@R is also known as average value at risk (AV@R) and expected shortfall (ES).
