# Riemann Liouville sense G1 scheme

```
fracdiff(f, Î±, start_point, end_point, h, RLG1())
```

Remove the limit symbol in the definition of Grunwald-Letnikov fractional derivative, thereby leading to a discretization scheme in form of truncated series.

!!! tip
    ```
    **RLG1** also can be used to compute fractional integral~
    ``+\alpha`` for fractional derivative and ``-\alpha`` for fractional integral.
