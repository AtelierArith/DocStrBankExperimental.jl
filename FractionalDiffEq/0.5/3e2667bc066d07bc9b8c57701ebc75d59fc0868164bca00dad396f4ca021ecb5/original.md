Defines an distributed order fractional ordinary differential equation (DODE) problem.

## Mathematical Specification of an distributed order FODE problem

To define an multi-terms FODE Problem, you simply need to given the parameters, their correspoding orders, right hand side function and the initial condition $u_0$  which define an FODE:

$$
\frac{du^\alpha}{d^{\alpha}t} = f(u,p,t)
$$

Distributed order differential equations.
