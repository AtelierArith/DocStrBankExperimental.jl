removeduplicates(rep::Representation)
```

Removes the duplicates in the Representation.

  * In an H-representation, it removes the redundant hyperplanes and it remove an halfspace when it is equal to another halfspace in the affine hull. For instance, `HalfSpace([1, 1], 1)` is equal to `HalfSpace([1, 0], 0)` in the affine hull generated by `HyperPlane([0, 1], 1])`.
  * In a V-representation, it removes the redundant lines and it remove a point (resp. ray) when it is equal to another point (resp. ray) in the line hull. For instance, in the line hull generated by `Line([0, 1])`, `[1, 1]` is equal to `[1, 0]` and `Ray([2, 2])` is equal to `Ray([1, 0])`.
