The probability of improvement measures the probability that a point `x` leads to an improvement upon an incumbent target `τ`. For Gaussian distributions it is given by

```
Φ[(μ(x) - τ)/σ(x)]
```

where `Φ` is the standard normal cumulative distribution function and `μ(x)`, `σ(x)` are mean and standard deviation of the distribution at point `x`.
