The acquisition function associated with `ThompsonSamplingSimple` draws independent samples for each input `x` a function value from the model. Together with a gradient-free optimization method this leads to proposal points that might be similarly distributed as the maxima of true Thompson samples from GPs. True Thompson samples from a GP are simply functions from a GP. Maximizing these samples can be tricky, see e.g. http://hildobijl.com/Downloads/GPRT.pdf chapter 6.
