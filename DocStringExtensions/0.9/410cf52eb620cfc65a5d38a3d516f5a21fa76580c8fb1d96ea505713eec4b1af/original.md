An [`Abbreviation`](@ref) for including the package LICENSE.md.

!!! note
    The LICENSE.md file is interpreted as ["Julia flavored Markdown"](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/documentation/#Markdown-syntax-1), which has some differences compared to GitHub flavored markdown, and, for example, [][] link shortcuts are not supported.
