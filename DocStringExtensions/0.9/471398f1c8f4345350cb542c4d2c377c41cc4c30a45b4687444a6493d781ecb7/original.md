An [`Abbreviation`](@ref) to include all the exported names of a module is a sorted list of `Documenter.jl`-style `@ref` links.

!!! note
    The names are sorted alphabetically and ignore leading `@` characters so that macros are *not* sorted before other names.


# Examples

The markdown text generated by the `EXPORTS` abbreviation looks similar to the following:

```markdown

  - [`bar`](@ref)
  - [`@baz`](@ref)
  - [`foo`](@ref)

```
