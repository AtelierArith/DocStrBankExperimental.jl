load_iris() -> X, y, names
```

Loads the first 150 observations from the Iris flower data set introduced by Ronald Fisher (1936). The 4 by 150 matrix `X` contains the numeric measurements, in which each individual column denotes an observation. The vector `y` contains the class labels as strings. The vector `names` contains the names of the features (i.e. rows of `X`)
