imag_memory_kernel_ft(J::AbstractSD, ω)
```

Calculate the imaginary part of the Fourier-transform of the  memory kernel for a spectral density `J` at a given frequency `ω`.

# Arguments

  * `J::AbstractSD`: The spectral density.
  * `ω`: The frequency at which the imaginary part of the Fourier-transform of the memory kernel is evaluated.

# Returns

  * The imaginary part of the Fourier-transform of the memory kernel for the spectral density `J` at the given frequency `ω`.
