```
mass(atom::Atom)
mass(atoms::AbstractVector{<:Atoms})
```

Returns the mass of an atom given its name, or `Atom` structure, or the total mass of a vector of `Atom`s. 

If a mass is defined as a custom field in the the `Atom` structure, it is returned. Otherwise, the mass is retrieved from the element mass as inferred from the atom name.

## Example

```jldoctest
julia> using PDBTools

julia> atoms = [ Atom(name="NT3"), Atom(name="CA") ];

julia> mass(atoms[1])
14.0067

julia> mass(atoms)
26.017699999999998
```
