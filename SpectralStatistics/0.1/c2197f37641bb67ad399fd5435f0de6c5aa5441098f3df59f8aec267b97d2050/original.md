GOE <: Model 

`GOE` is a concrete type used to represent the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble model of random matrix theory. 

## Description

Based on the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture this model describes the spectral statistics (in the semiclassical limit)  of chaotic systems, invariant under time-reversal symmetry and without spin 1/2 interactions.

## Attributes

This model has no attributes.
