```
result::Union{Any, Tuple{Any, ...}} = JUA_Server_call(server::JUA_Server, request::JUA_CallMethodRequest)
```

uses the server API to process the method call request `request` on the `server`. `result` is the outputs generated by the method called. This is typically a number or a string (or an Array thereof). If the method produces multiple outputs, they are returned as a tuple.

```
result::Union{Any, Tuple{Any, ...}} = JUA_Server_call(server::JUA_Server, objectid::JUA_NodeId, 
    methodid::JUA_NodeId, inputarg)
```

An even higher level method that creates the `JUA_CallMethodRequest` internally. Equivalent to `JUA_Client_call` on the client side.
