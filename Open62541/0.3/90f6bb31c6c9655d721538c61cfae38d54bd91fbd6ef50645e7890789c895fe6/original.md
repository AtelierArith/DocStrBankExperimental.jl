```
UA_UadpWriterGroupMessageDataType_equal(p1::Ptr{Open62541.UA_UadpWriterGroupMessageDataType}, p2::Ptr{Open62541.UA_UadpWriterGroupMessageDataType})::Bool
```

compares `p1` and `p2` and returns `true` if they are equal. Also works  with the corresponding high-level types (`JUA_xxx`) if they have been  defined.
