```
random_reinsert_removed!(::PermutationSolution)
```

Repair solution by inserting the elements from `destroyed` at random positions.

Note that this is a very naive repair heuristic just for demonstration purposes. In a real application, the repair would, for example, test all possible insertion positions and select the best one for each element in `destroyed`.
