`AbstractRGB{T}` is an abstract supertype for red/green/blue color types that can be constructed as `C(r, g, b)` and for which the elements can be extracted as `red(c)`, `green(c)`, `blue(c)`. You should *not* make assumptions about internal storage order, the number of fields, or the representation. One `AbstractRGB` color-type, `RGB24`, is not parametric and does not have fields named `r`, `g`, `b`.
