`chroma(c)` returns the chroma of a `Lab`, `Luv`, `Oklab` or their variants color.

!!! note
    The other color types (e.g. `RGB`, `HSV` or `YCbCr`) are not supported because their definitions of *chroma* are not clear. Colorfulness, chroma and saturation are defined as distinct aspects by the CIE.
