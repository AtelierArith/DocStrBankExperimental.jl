`AbstractGray{T}` is an abstract supertype for gray types which corresponds to real numbers, where `0` means black and `1` means white.

!!! compat "ColorTypes v0.12"
    Prior to ColorTypes v0.12, `AbstractGray{T}` was the alias for `Color{T,1}`; after ColorTypes v0.12, `Color{T,1}` does not necessarily correspond to the black-gray-white colors.
