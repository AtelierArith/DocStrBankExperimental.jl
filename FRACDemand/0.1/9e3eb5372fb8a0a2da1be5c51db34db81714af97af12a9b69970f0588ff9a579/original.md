`HaltonDraws!{T<:AbstractFloat}(H::Vector{T}, B::Int, [skip::Int=500, distr=Normal()])`
```

Copied from an old version of Halton.jl. Replaces `H` with draws from a distribution `Distributions.dist()`. Draws are generated by using Halton sequence with base `B` as the quantiles drawn. Keyword argument `skip` is the number initial "burn-in" elements to drop.
