```
sequentialresidues(res_first, res_second)
```

Determine if the second residue follows the first in sequence.

For this to be `true` the residues need to have the same chain ID, both need to be standard/hetero residues and the residue number of the second needs to be one greater than that of the first (or the residue numbers the same and the insertion code of the second greater than the first).
