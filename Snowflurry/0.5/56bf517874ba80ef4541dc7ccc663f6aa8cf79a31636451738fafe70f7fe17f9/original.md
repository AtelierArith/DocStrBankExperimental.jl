```
universal(target, theta, phi, lambda)
```

Return a gate which rotates the `target` qubit given the angles `theta`, `phi`, and `lambda`. See Theorem 4.1 in [Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Nielsen and Chuang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Computation_and_Quantum_Information).

The corresponding `Operator` is [`universal(theta, phi, lambda)`](@ref).
