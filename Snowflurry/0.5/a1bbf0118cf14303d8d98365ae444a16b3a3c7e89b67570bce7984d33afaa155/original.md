```
AllToAllConnectivity <:AbstractConnectivity
```

A data structure which describes the all-to-all qubit connectivity of an Anyon Systems QPU. This connectivity type is encountered in simulated `QPUs` such as the [`VirtualQPU`](@ref).

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> connectivity = AllToAllConnectivity()
AllToAllConnectivity()

```
