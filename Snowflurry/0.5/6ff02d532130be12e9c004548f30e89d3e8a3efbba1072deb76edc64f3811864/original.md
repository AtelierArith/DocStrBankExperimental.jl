```
root_zz(qubit_1, qubit_2)
```

Return the root of a ZZ `Gate`. The application of two ZZ gates in sequence is equivalent to  the application of one `rotation_z(-π/2)` `Operator` to `qubit_1` and one `rotation_z(π/2)` `Operator` to `qubit_2`.

The corresponding `Operator` is [`root_zz()`](@ref).
