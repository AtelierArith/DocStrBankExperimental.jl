Basic unit in describing composition of a phase or system. Critical to most calculations.  Typically the only values that will ever changed are mol and chemical potential.

  * `name::String`: Name of the component
  * `molarmass::Float64`: Molar mass (g/mol)
  * `mol::Float64`: Moles of the component
  * `cat::Real`: Number of cations
  * `ox::Real`: Number of oxygen atoms
  * `catcharge::Real`: Charge on cations
  * `Î¼::Float64`: Chemical potential (J/mol)
