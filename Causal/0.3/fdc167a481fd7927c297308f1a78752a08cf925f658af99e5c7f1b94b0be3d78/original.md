```julia
struct Fifo <: Causal.LinearMode
```

Fifo (First-in-last-out) buffer mode. This type of buffer is a *first-in-first-out* buffer. The data is written to the buffer until the buffer is full. When the buffer is full, no more element can be written into the buffer. When read, the first element written into the buffer is returned. The returned element is deleted from the buffer.
