```julia
struct Lifo <: Causal.LinearMode
```

Lifo (Last-in-first-out) buffer mode. This type of buffer is a *last-in-first-out* buffer. Data is written to the buffer until the buffer is full. When the buffer is full, no more element can be written into the buffer. When read, the last element written into buffer is returned. The returned element is deleted from the buffer.
