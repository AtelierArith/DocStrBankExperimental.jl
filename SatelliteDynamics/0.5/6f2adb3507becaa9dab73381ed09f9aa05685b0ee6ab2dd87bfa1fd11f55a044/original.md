GravModel stores a spherical harmonic gravity field in memory. Can store normalized or denomalized coefficients. Package contains EGM2008, GGM01S, and GGM0S gravity models, as well as the default gravity model of EGM2008 truncated to degree and order 90.

Additional gravity field models can be downloaded from: [http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de/home](http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de/home)

Arguments:

  * `filepath::string` Path to spherical harmonic gravity model file.
