`GaussianBasis` is a *subtype* of `Basis` that stores the coefficients, exponents and angular momenta of the atomic orbital. A basis set in theoretical and computational chemistry is a set of functions (called basis functions) that is used to represent the  electronic wave function in the Hartree–Fock method or density-functional theory in order to turn the partial differential equations  of the model into algebraic equations suitable for efficient implementation on a computer. The use of basis sets is equivalent to the  use of an approximate resolution of the identity: the orbitals $\vert \psi_{i} \rangle$ are expanded within the basis set as a linear combination of the basis functions $\vert \psi_{i} \rangle \approx \sum_{\mu } c_{\mu i} \vert \mu \rangle$,  where the expansion coefficients $c_{\mu i}$ are given by $c_{\mu i} = \sum_{\nu } \langle \mu \vert \nu \rangle^{-1}  \langle \nu \vert \psi_{i} \rangle$. The basis set can either be composed of atomic orbitals (yielding the linear combination of  atomic orbitals approach), which is the usual choice within the quantum chemistry community; plane waves which are typically used within  the solid state community, or real-space approaches. Several types of atomic orbitals can be used: Gaussian-type orbitals, Slater-type  orbitals, or numerical atomic orbitals. Out of the three, Gaussian-type orbitals are by far the most often used, as they allow efficient  implementations of Post-Hartree–Fock methods.
