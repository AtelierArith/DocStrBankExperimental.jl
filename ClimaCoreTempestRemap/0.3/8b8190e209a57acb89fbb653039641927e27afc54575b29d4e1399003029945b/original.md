```
write_exodus(filename, topology::Topology2D; normalize_coordinates=true)
```

Write the topology to an Exodus-formatted NetCDF file.

It tries to adhere to the Exodus II specification, but it is primarily intended for use with TempestRemap.

Note: the generated meshes will use a different ordering of nodes and elements than those generated by TempestRemap itself.

When using this function with a distributed topology input for MPI, it should only be called on a single process.

Options:

  * `normalize_coordinates`: if true, the coordinates are normalized to be on the unit sphere (this is required for use with TempestRemap)
