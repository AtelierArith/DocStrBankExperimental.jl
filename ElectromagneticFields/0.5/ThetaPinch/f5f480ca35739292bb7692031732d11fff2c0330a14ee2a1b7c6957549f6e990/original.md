θ-pinch equilibrium in (x,y,z) coordinates with covariant components of the vector potential given by

$$
A (x,y,z) = \frac{B_0}{2} \big( - y , \, x , \, 0 \big)^T
$$

resulting in the magnetic field with covariant components

$$
B (x,y,z) = \big( 0 , \, 0 , \, B_0 \big)^T .
$$

Parameters:     B₀: B-field at magnetic axis
