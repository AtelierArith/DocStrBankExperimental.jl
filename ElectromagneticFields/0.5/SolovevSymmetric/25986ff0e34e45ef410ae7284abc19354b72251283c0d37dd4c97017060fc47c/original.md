Symmetric Solov'ev equilibrium in (R,Z,phi) coordinates. Based on McCarthy, Physics of Plasmas 6, 3554, 1999.

The covariant components of the vector potential are given by

$$
A (x, y) = \frac{B_0}{2} \, \bigg( 0 , \, 0 , \, - \frac{\alpha}{4} (R_0 + x)^4 - \beta y^2 \bigg)^T ,
$$

Parameters:

  * `R₀`: position of magnetic axis
  * `B₀`: B-field at magnetic axis
  * `α`, `β`: free constants
