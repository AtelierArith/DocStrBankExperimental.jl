```julia
CameraCalibrationMutable(img)

```

Constructor helper assuming you just have a camera image and need to start somewhere for a basic camera model.

Notes:

  * Calibration will incorrect but hopefully in a distant ballpark to get the calibration process started.
  * See [AprilTags.jl Calibration section](https://juliarobotics.org/AprilTags.jl/latest/#Camera-Calibration-1) for code and help.
