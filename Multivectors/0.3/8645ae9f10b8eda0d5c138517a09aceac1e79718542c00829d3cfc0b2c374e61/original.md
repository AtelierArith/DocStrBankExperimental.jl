lcontraction(A, B)
```

The left contraction of A on B.  Generalizes the dot product from linear algebra. The contraction A⌋B of an a-blade A onto a b-blade B is a sub-blade of B with grade b-a which is perpendicular to A and linear in both arguments. The returned multivector, k-vector or blade will be the part of A contained in B and also orthogonal to A's projection on B.   When one considers a scalar to be orthogonal to a 1-vector.  The standard dot product ⋅ defined on 1-vectors in fact does just this.  A scalar on a 1-vector is indeed orthogonal to any vectors projection on that vector.
