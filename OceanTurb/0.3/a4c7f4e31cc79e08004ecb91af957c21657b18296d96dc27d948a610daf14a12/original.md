prettytime(t)
```

Convert a floating point value `t` representing an amount of time in seconds to a more human-friendly formatted string with three decimal places. Depending on the value of `t` the string will be formatted to show `t` in nanoseconds (ns), microseconds (Î¼s), milliseconds (ms), seconds (s), minutes (min), hours (hr), or days (day).
