```
ProportionalBandSpectrum(TBandsC, cfreq_start, pbs, scaler=1)
```

Construct a `ProportionalBandSpectrum` from an array of proportional band amplitudes and proportional band type `TBandsC`.

`cfreq_start` is the centerband frequency corresponding to the first entry of `pbs`.  The proportional band frequencies indicated by `TBandsC` are multiplied by `scaler`.
