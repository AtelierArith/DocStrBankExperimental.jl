Align an ensemble to itself. See Bakan and Bahar, PNAS, 2009 for algorithm. The single Kabsch alignment is used during iteration, then the iterative alignment is done at the end. Returns the structure the final alignment was on, not the ensemble average (but they will be close). The cutoff parameter determines the RMSD between two average structures below which iteration is terminated.
