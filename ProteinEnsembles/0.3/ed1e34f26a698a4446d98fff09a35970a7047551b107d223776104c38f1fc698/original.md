Align the first set of atomic coordinates to the second using an iterative procedure. At each step atoms with a high structural deviation are removed. If the standard deviation of the structural deviations is greater than `cutoff`, then structural deviations further than 2 standard deviations from the median are discarded. This is repeated `n_cycles` times. If `calpha` is true, only considers the C-alpha atoms.
