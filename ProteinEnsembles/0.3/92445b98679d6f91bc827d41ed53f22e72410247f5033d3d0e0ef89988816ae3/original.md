Find new interactions arising from fake modulator atoms and form a new `Constraints` object. Arguments are atoms to calculate constraints with, `Constraints` object to add to, generated modulator coordinates, distance cutoff and constraint tolerances for intra-modulator and modulator-protein interactions, and minimum lower distance constraint. Returns a new `Constraints` object including the modulator.
