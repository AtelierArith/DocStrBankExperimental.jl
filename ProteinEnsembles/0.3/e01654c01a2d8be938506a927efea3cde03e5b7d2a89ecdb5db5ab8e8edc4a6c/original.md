Finds distance constraints from a set of interactions and distances. Returns a `Constraints` object. All explicit interactions calculated - other interactions written with probability such that `other_ratio` times n_atoms other interactions are written. Sparse interactions scale as N but other interactions scale as N^2, hence the use of a ratio rather than a direct probability to keep the sparse/other ratio roughly constant. The hard sphere radii are multiplied by 0.8 to reduce the number of erroneous constraints.
