Projects the structure in a PDB file onto the eigenvectors of a PCA. The residue numbering between the PDB files must be consistent but missing/extra residues are allowed. Reads the PDB file, maps the atoms to the ref atoms, aligns the atoms to the ref atoms then gets the projections. Arguments are PDB filepath, reference atoms to get atom map, coords to align to and the PCA object.
