DubinsManeuver3D(qi, qf, rhomin, pitchlims)
```

Create 3D Dubins path between two configurations qi, qf     * qi - initial configuration (x, y, z, heading, pitch)     * qf - final configuration (x, y, z, heading, pitch)     * rhomin - minimum turning radius     * pitchlims - limits of the pitch angle [pitch*min, pitch*max]
