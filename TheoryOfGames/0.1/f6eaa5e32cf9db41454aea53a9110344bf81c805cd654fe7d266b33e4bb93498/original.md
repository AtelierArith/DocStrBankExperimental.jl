specific*least*core(mode, dist*objective, player*set, utilities, optimizer; verbose)

Function to calculte the least core profit distribution for a game described by the utility function and the grand coalition of player_set. This function implements an iterative approach by using a column generating approach to iteratively add constraints to the master problem. To do so, the callback function stored in the mode category is exploited

## Inputs

mode : IterMode     Calculation mode that contains the reference to the callback function     that given a profit distribution scheme, returns a tuple of     the set of the coalition with the worst profit and its total benefit to be shared     callback*worst*coalition accepts one argument (current profit sharing) dist*objective : Function     Function to build the objective function of the profit distribution, after the least core     is obtained     It shall be a function with two arguments: the JuMP model of the problem and the player set,     and the function shall build the desired objective functions using the      JuMP @NLobjective or @objective commands optimizer : Any     Optimizer function for the JuMP model used for computation purposes start*time : (optional, default nothing)     Specify the initial time of the method; if nothing the value is initialized by time() rtol : Number (optional, default 1e-2)     Relative tolerance of the convergence process atol : Number (optional, default 1e-2)     Absolute tolerance of the convergence process lower*bound : Number (optional, default nothing)     Lower bound of the variables of the problem (benefit distribution and margin of the worst coalition) upper*bound : Number (optional, default nothing)     Upper bound of the variables of the problem (benefit distribution and margin of the worst coalition)     When nothing, the value is automatically set to the benefit of the grand coalition verbose : Bool (optional, default true)     When true, it shows a progress bar to describe the current execution status raw*outputs : Bool (optional, default false)     When true, it returns all raw outputs use*start*value : Bool (optional, default false)     When true, in the iterative process the previous iteration value is used as initialization     for the followin iteration max*iter : Bool (optional, default 100)     Maximum number of iterations of the process best*objective*stop*option : String (optional, default nothing)     Name of the option to stop the lower problem as it reaches a preset value.     When this option is nothing, this feature is not used.     When this option is non-nothing, in every iteration, a minimum convergence criterion is added     so to stop the lower problem as soon as a minimum fesible objective function is reached.     This minimum objective value is obtained with respect to the solution of the master problem     multiplied by the factor "best*objective*stop*tolerance"     If gurobi is used, this option is BestObjStop best*objective*stop*tolerance : Number (optional, default 0.05)     Tolerance used in the "best*objective*stop*option" approach lower*relaxation*stop*option : String (optional, default nothing)     Name of the option used to setup the stop criterion of the optimization as soon as     the lowest bound reaches the tolerance specified by tolerance*lower*relaxation*stop option tolerance*lower*relaxation*stop : double (optional, default 0.0)     When lower*relaxation*stop*option is enabled, this option specifies the tolerance used     to stop the loop

## Outputs

profit*distribution     Benefit distribution by player min*surplus     Benefit of the coalition with the minimum surplus history
