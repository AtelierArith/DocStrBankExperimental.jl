```
restart(p_file::String, a_file::String; r_args...)
```

Restart a simulation, given past parameters and arguments plus time step info.

The `Params` from the previous run are used once again, as well as the previous keyword arguments. Additional arguments can be passed in through `r_args`, and overwrite their predecessors. It is required that the set of time steps `Î”ts`, initial time `t0`, and initial time ID `t0_id` are passed in again.
