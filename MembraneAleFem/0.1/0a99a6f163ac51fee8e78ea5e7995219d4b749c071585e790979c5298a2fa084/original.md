```
solve(p::Params; args...)
```

Main function, which solves any [`Scenario`](@ref) for the given [`Parameters`](@ref man-params).

The [`Mesh`](@ref) struct (`mesh`), initial positions (`xms`), and initial control points (`cps`) are first generated by calling [`prepare_input`](@ref). With these initial data, [`run_analysis!`](@ref) is called to solve for the membrane unknowns and positions at a series of discrete timesâ€”for which `xms` and `cps` are repeatedly updated. Appropriate data is written to output at each time step, and the final `mesh`, `xms` and `cps` are returned.
