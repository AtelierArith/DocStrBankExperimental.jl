kronecker_matrix(qtls::AbstractVector)
```

Compute the matrix given by the Kronecker vectors according to Equation (6) of Wang et Al. (2017). This matrix is used to compute the approximate GLRT statistic to test the null hypothesis that the main effects and the second order interactions of a log-linear model are stable.
