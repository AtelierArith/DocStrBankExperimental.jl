```
jacobi_vandermonde(nodes, α, β)
```

Computes the Vandermonde matrix with respect to the Jacobi polynomials with parameters `α`, `β` and the nodal basis on `nodes`. The Vandermonde matrix `V` is the transformation matrix from the modal Jacobi basis to the nodal Lagrange basis associated with `nodes`.
