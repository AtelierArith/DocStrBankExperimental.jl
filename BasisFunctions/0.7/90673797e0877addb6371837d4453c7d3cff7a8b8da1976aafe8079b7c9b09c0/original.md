A `DenseSubdict` is a large subset of a dictionary. Operators associated with the subset are implemented in terms of corresponding operators on the underlying dictionary. This often leads to an explicit extension to the full set, but it can take advantage of possible fast implementations for the underlying dictionary. For large subsets this is more efficient than iterating over the individual elements.
