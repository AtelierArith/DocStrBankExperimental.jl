A PiecewiseInterval is a subdivision of an interval into a number of subintervals. The subintervals are determined by a set of breakpoints $t_i$, $i=0,...,n$. The main interval is $[t_0,t_n]$. The subintervals always contain the right endpoint, i.e. the first subinterval is $[t_0,t_1]$, the second is the halfopen interval $(t_1,t_2]$ and so on until the n-th interval $(t_{n-1},t_n]$.
