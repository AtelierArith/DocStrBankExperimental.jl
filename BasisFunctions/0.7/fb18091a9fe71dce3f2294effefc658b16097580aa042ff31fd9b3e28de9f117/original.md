Return a normalization for a sampling operator on a grid. The normalization ensures a norm equivalence between the continuous norm of the function space associated with the measure, and the discrete norm of the sampling vector.

In practice, this amounts to a diagonal scaling with the square roots of the weights of a quadrature rule on the grid that is exact on the span of the dictionary in the space.
