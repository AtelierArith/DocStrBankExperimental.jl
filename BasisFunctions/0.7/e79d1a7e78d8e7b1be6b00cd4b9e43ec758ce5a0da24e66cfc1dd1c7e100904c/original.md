Evaluate an orthogonal polynomial using the three term recurrence relation. The recurrence relation is assumed to have the form: '''     p*{n+1}(x) = (A*n x + B*n) * p*n(x) - C*n * p*{n-1}(x)     p*{-1} = 0; p*0 = p0 ''' with the coefficients implemented by the `rec_An`, `rec_Bn` and `rec_Cn` functions and with the initial value implemented with the `p0` function. This is the convention followed by the DLMF, see `http://dlmf.nist.gov/18.9#i`.
