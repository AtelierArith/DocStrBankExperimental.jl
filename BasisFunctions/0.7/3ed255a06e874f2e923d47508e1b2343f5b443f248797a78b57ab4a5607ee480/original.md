Dictionaries are ordered lists. Their ordering is defined by the way their index sets are ordered.

The `ordering` of a dictionary returns a list-like object that can be indexed with integers between `1` and `length(dict)`. This operation returns the corresponding native index. This defines the ordering of the native index set of the dictionary.
