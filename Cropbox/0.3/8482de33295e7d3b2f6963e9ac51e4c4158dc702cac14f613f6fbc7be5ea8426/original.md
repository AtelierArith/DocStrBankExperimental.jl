```
dive(s)
```

Inspect an instance of system `s` by navigating hierarchy of variables displayed in a tree structure.

Pressing up/down arrow keys allows navigation. Press 'enter' to dive into a deeper level and press 'q' to come back. A leaf node of the tree shows an output of `look` regarding the variable. Pressing 'enter' again would return a variable itself and exit to REPL.

Only works in a terminal environment; not working on Jupyter Notebook.
