```
PeriodicGraphEmbedding{D,T}
```

Embedding in euclidean space of a `PeriodicGraph` of dimension `D`. Each vertex is assigned a `D`-uplet of coordinates of type `T`.

`PeriodicGraphEmbedding3D` is provided as an alias for `PeriodicGraphEmbedding{3}`. Symmetry detection provided by PeriodicGraphEmbeddings.jl can only be performed on `PeriodicGraphEmbedding3D`.
