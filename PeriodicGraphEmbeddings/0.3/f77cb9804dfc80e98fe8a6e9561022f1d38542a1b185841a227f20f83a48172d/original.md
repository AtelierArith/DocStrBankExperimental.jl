Cell{T}
```

Representation of a periodic cell in 3D. Contains information about the cell (axes lengths and angles) and its symmetry group, through its Hall number.

See [`PeriodicGraphEmbeddings.SPACE_GROUP_HALL`](@ref), [`PeriodicGraphEmbeddings.SPACE_GROUP_FULL`](@ref), [`PeriodicGraphEmbeddings.SPACE_GROUP_HM`](@ref) and [`PeriodicGraphEmbeddings.SPACE_GROUP_IT`](@ref) for the correspondance between Hall number and usual symbolic representations.
