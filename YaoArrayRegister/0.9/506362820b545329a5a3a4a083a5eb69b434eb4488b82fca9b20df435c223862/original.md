YaoArrayRegister.jl is a component package in the [Yao.jl](https://github.com/QuantumBFS/Yao.jl) ecosystem. It provides the most basic functionality for quantum computation simulation in Julia and a quantum register type `ArrayReg`. You will be able to simulate a quantum circuit alone with this package in principle.
