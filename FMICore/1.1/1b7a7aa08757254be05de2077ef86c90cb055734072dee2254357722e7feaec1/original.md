Source: FMISpec3.0, Version D5ef1c1: 2.2.12. Getting Derivatives of Continuous Outputs

Retrieves the n-th derivative of output values.

valueReferences - is a vector of value references that define the variables whose derivatives shall be retrieved. If multiple derivatives of a variable shall be retrieved, list the value reference multiple times.

nValueReferences - is the dimension of the arguments valueReferences and orders.

orders - contains the orders of the respective derivative (1 means the first derivative, 2 means the second derivative, …, 0 is not allowed).  If multiple derivatives of a variable shall be retrieved, provide a list of them in the orders array, corresponding to a multiply occurring value reference in the valueReferences array. The highest order of derivatives retrievable can be determined by the 'maxOutputDerivativeOrder' tag in the ModelDescription.

values - is a vector with the values of the derivatives. The order of the values elements is derived from a twofold serialization: the outer level corresponds to the combination of a value reference (e.g., valueReferences[k]) and order (e.g., orders[k]), and the inner level to the serialization of variables as defined in Section 2.2.6.1. The inner level does not exist for scalar variables.

nValues - is the size of the argument values. nValues only equals nValueReferences if all corresponding output variables are scalar variables.
