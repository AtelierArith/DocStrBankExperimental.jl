Source: FMISpec3.0, Version D5ef1c1: 2.2.11. Getting Partial Derivatives

This function computes the directional derivatives v*{sensitivity} = J â‹… v*{seed} of an FMU.

unknowns - contains value references to the unknowns.

nUnknowns - contains the length of argument unknowns.

knowns - contains value references of the knowns.

nKnowns - contains the length of argument knowns.

seed - contains the components of the seed vector.

nSeed - contains the length of seed.

sensitivity - contains the components of the sensitivity vector.

nSensitivity - contains the length of sensitivity.

This function can only be called if the 'ProvidesDirectionalDerivatives' tag in the ModelDescription is set.
