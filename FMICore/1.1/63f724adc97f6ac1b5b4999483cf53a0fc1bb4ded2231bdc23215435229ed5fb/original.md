Informs the FMU to enter Initialization Mode. Before calling this function, all variables with attribute <ScalarVariable initial = "exact" or "approx"> can be set with the “fmi2SetXXX” functions (the ScalarVariable attributes are defined in the Model Description File, see section 2.2.7). Setting other variables is not allowed. Furthermore, fmi2SetupExperiment must be called at least once before calling fmi2EnterInitializationMode, in order that startTime is defined.
