fmi3Fatal: The state of all instances of the model is irreparably corrupted. [For example, due to a runtime exception such as access violation or integer division by zero during the execution of an FMI function.] Function logMessage should be called by the FMU with further information before returning this status, respecting the current logging settings, if still possible. It is not allowed to call any other function for any instance of the FMU.
