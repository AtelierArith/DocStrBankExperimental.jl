Source: FMISpec3.0, Version D5ef1c1: 2.2.9.4. Scheduled Execution Enumeration that defines the IntervalQualifiers which describe how to treat the intervals and intervalCounters arguments. They have the following meaning: fmi3IntervalNotYetKnown -  is returned for a countdown aperiodic Clock for which the next interval is not yet known. This qualifier value can only be returned directly after the Clock was active and previous calls to fmi3GetInterval never returned fmi3IntervalChanged (nor fmi3IntervalUnchanged). In Scheduled Execution this return value means that the corresponding model partition cannot be scheduled yet.

fmi3IntervalUnchanged - is returned if a previous call to fmi3GetInterval already returned a value qualified with fmi3IntervalChanged which has not changed since. In Scheduled Execution this means the corresponding model partition has already been scheduled.

fmi3IntervalChanged - is returned to indicate that the value for the interval has changed for this Clock. Any previously returned intervals (if any) are overwritten with the current value. The new Clock interval is relative to the time of the current Event Mode or Clock Update Mode in contrast to the interval of a periodic Clock, where the interval is defined as the time between consecutive Clock ticks. In Scheduled Execution this means that the corresponding model partition has to be scheduled or re-scheduled (if a previous call to fmi3GetInterval returned fmi3IntervalChanged).
