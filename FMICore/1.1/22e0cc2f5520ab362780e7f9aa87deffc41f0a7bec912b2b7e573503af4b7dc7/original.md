fmi3Error: The call failed. The output argument values are undefined and the simulation cannot be continued. Function logMessage should be called by the FMU with further information before returning this status, respecting the current logging settings. If a function returns fmi3Error, it is possible to restore a previously retrieved FMU state by calling fmi3SetFMUState. Otherwise fmi3FreeInstance or fmi3Reset must be called. When detecting illegal arguments or a function call not allowed in the current state according to the respective state machine, the FMU must return fmi3Error. Other instances of this FMU are not affected by the error.
