fmi3Discard: The call was not successful and the FMU is in the same state as before the call. The output argument values are not defined, but the computation can continue. Function logMessage should be called by the FMU with further information before returning this status, respecting the current logging settings. Advanced simulation algorithms can try alternative approaches to drive the simulation by calling the function with different arguments or calling another function. Otherwise the simulation algorithm has to treat this return code like fmi3Error and has to terminate the simulation. [Examples for usage of fmi3Discard are handling of min/max violation, or signal numerical problems during model evaluation forcing smaller step sizes.]
