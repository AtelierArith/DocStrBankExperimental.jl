Source: FMISpec3.0, Version D5ef1c1:2.4.7.5. Type specific properties Enumeration that defines how the variable is initialized, i.e. if a fmi3Set{VariableType} is allowed and how the FMU internally treats this value in Instantiated and Initialization Mode. For the variable with causality = independent, the attribute initial must not be provided, because its start value is set with the startTime parameter of fmi3EnterInitializationMode.

The attribute initial for other variables can have the following values and meanings:

exact - The variable is initialized with the start value (provided under the variable type element).

approx - The start value provides an approximation that may be modified during initialization, e.g., if the FMU is part of an algebraic loop where the variable might be an iteration variable and start value is taken as initial value for an iterative solution process.

calculated - The variable is calculated from other variables during initialization. It is not allowed to provide a start value.

If initial is not present, it is defined by Table 22 based on causality and variability. If initial = exact or approx, or causality = input, a start value must be provided. If initial = calculated, or causality = independent, it is not allowed to provide a start value.

[The environment decides when to use the start value of a variable with causality = input. Examples: * Automatic tests of FMUs are performed, and the FMU is tested by providing the start value as constant input. * For a Model Exchange FMU, the FMU might be part of an algebraic loop. If the input variable is iteration variable of this algebraic loop, then initialization starts with its start value.]

If fmi3Set{VariableType} is not called on a variable with causality = input, then the FMU must use the start value as value of this input.

Added prefix "fmi3" to help with redefinition of constans in enums.
