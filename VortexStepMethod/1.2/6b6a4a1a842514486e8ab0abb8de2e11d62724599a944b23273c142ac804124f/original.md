AeroModel `LEI_AIRFOIL_BREUKELS` `POLAR_VECTORS` `POLAR_MATRICES` `INVISCID`

Enumeration of the implemented aerodynamic models. See also: [AeroData](@ref)

# Elements

  * `LEI_AIRFOIL_BREUKELS`: Polynom approximation for leading edge inflatable kites
  * `POLAR_VECTORS`: Polar vectors as function of alpha (lookup tables with interpolation)
  * `POLAR_MATRICES`: Polar matrices as function of alpha and delta (lookup tables with interpolation)
  * INVISCID

where `alpha` is the angle of attack, `delta` is trailing edge angle.
