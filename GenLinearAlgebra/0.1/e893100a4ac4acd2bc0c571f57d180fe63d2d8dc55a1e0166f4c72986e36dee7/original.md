`rowspace(m::AbstractMatrix)`

returns a canonical form of the rowspace of `m` (the vector space generated by  the rows of `m`),  the echelon form. This  is a particular basis of the rowspace  of `m`: the first non-zero element of each line is 1, and such an element  is also the only non-zero  element in its column. Integer matrices are converted to `Rational` before applying this function.

```julia-repl
julia> m=[1 2;2 4;5 6]
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 2  4
 5  6

julia> rowspace(m)
2×2 view(::Matrix{Rational{Int64}}, 1:2, :) with eltype Rational{Int64}:
 1  0
 0  1
```
