COCOS Structure

```
cocos::Int           = COCOS ID number
exp_Bp::Int          = 0 or 1, depending if psi is already divided by 2pi or not, respectively
sigma_Bp::Int        = +1 or -1, depending if psi is increasing or decreasing with Ip and B0 positive
sigma_RpZ::Int       = +1 or -1, depending if (R,phi,Z) is right-handed or (R,Z,phi), respectively
sigma_rhotp::Int     = +1 or -1, depending if (rho, theta, phi) is right-handed or (rho,phi,theta), repectively
sign_q_pos::Int      = +1 or -1, depending if q is positive or negative with Ip and B0 positive
sign_pprime_pos::Int = +1 or -1, depending if dp/dpsi is positive or negative with Ip and B0 positive
