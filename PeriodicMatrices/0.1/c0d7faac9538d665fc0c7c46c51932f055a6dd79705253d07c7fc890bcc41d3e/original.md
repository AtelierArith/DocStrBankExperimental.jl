```
pmtrmulsym(B, C, β)
```

Compute the symmetric periodic matrix `β*B'*C`, where `β` is a real scalar and the product `B'*C` is known to be symmetric.  All matrix arguments may be constant matrices as well.

*Note:* This function is available only for periodic matrices of types `PeriodicArray`, `PeriodicMatrix`, `PeriodicFunctionMatrix` and `HarmonicArray`.
