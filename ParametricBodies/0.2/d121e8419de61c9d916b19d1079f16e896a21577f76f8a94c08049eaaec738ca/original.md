NurbsCurve(pnts,knos,weights)
```

Define a non-uniform rational B-spline curve.

  * `pnts`: A 2D array representing the control points of the NURBS curve
  * `knots`: A 1D array of th knot vector of the NURBS curve
  * `wgts`: A 1D array of the wight of the pnts of the NURBS curve
  * `d`: The degree of the NURBS curve
  * `n`: the spacial dimension of the NURBS curve, n âˆˆ {2,3}
