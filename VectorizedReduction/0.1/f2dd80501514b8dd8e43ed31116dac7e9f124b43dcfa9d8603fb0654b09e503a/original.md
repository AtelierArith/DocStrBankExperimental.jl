```
vtany([p=identity,] A::AbstractArray, dims=:)
```

Determine whether predicate `p` returns true for any elements over the given `dims`. If `p` is omitted, test whether any values along the given `dims` are `true` (in which case `A` should be `AbstractArray{Bool}`). Threaded.

# Additional Notes

This function suffers from the same issue as `vfindmax` and friends â€“ reductions which include the first dimension with zero masks are not yet supported by LoopVectorization. Notably, this function still works as intended for any reduction which does not involve the first dimension.
