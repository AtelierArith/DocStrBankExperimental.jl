ADAPTIVERESONANCE_VERSION

# Description

A constant that contains the version of the installed AdaptiveResonance.jl package.

This value is computed at compile time, so it may be used to programmatically verify the version of `AdaptiveResonance` that is installed in case a `compat` entry in your Project.toml is missing or otherwise incorrect.
