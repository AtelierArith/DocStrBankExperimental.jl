The module provides example calculations for the second edition of the book

> Kriele M. and Wolf, J. *Wertorientiertes Risikomanagement von Versicherungsunternehmen*,  2nd edition, Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg,  2016 (to be published)


It is also intended to use these examples for future editions of the English  translation of this book, *Value-Oriented Risk Management of Insurance Companies*. (The examples in both the first German edition and the first  English edition are written in R).

The module consists of 4 distinct parts:

  * *SSTLife*: An extremely simplified example of the SST

(Swiss Solvency Test) calculation for life insurance. The Swiss Solvency Test is the Swiss regulatory capital requirement.  The resulting monetary requirement is referred to as the "target capital" `ZK`.

  * *S2Life*: A simplified example of the S2 (Solvency 2)

calculation for non-life insurance. Solvency 2 is the new regulatory capital requirement in the European Union. The resulting monetary requirement is referred to as the "Solvency capital requirement" `SCR`.

  * *S2NonLife*: A simplified example of the S2 calculation

for life insurance

  * *ECModel*: An extremely simplified example of an internal

economic capital model for non-life insurance. This model is used to illustrate some techniques used in value based management.

Note that we have simplified and (in part changed for our exposition) the regulatory requirements for SST and Solvency 2. Also note that the implementation of Solvency 2 may be slightly different in different EU countries. For definitive information about SST or Solvency 2, please consult the original literature and any guidance issued by the supervisory authorities in the jurisdiction of interest.
