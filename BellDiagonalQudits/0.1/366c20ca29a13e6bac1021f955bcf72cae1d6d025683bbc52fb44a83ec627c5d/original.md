Represents an entanglement witness $W$ with extrema to detect entangled Bell diagonal states.

  * coords: Coordinates in Bell basis.
  * upperBound: Upper bound of $tr W \rho$ satisfied by all separable states $\rho$. Violation detects entanglement.
  * lowerBound: Lower bound of $tr W \rho$ satisfied by all separable states $\rho$. Violation detects entanglement.
  * checkedIterations: Number of iterations used in the optimization of bounds.
