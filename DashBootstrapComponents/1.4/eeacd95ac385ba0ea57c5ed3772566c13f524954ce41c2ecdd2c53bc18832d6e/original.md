A Pagination component. The container for presentational components for building a pagination UI. Individual pages should be added as children using the `PaginationItem` component. Keyword arguments:

  * `id` (String; optional): The ID of this component, used to identify dash components

in callbacks. The ID needs to be unique across all of the components in an app.

  * `active_page` (Real; optional): The currently active page
  * `className` (String; optional): **DEPRECATED** - Use class_name instead.

Often used with CSS to style elements with common properties.

  * `class_name` (String; optional): Often used with CSS to style elements with common properties.
  * `first_last` (Bool; optional): When True, this will display a first and last icon at the beginning

and end of the component.

  * `fully_expanded` (Bool; optional): When True, this will display all numbers between `min_value` and

`max_value`.

  * `loading_state` (optional): Object that holds the loading state object coming from dash-renderer. loading*state has the following type: lists containing elements 'is*loading', 'prop*name', 'component*name'.

Those elements have the following types:

  * `is_loading` (Bool; optional): Determines if the component is loading or not
  * `prop_name` (String; optional): Holds which property is loading
  * `component_name` (String; optional): Holds the name of the component that is loading
  * `max_value` (Real; required): Maximum (rightmost) value to appear in the pagination. Must be defined.

If the `min_value` and `step` together cannot reach this value, then the next stepped value is used as the maximum.

  * `min_value` (Real; optional): Minimum (leftmost) value to appear in the pagination.
  * `previous_next` (Bool; optional): When True, this will display a previous and next icon before and after

the individual page numbers.

  * `size` (a value equal to: 'sm', 'lg'; optional): Set the size of all page items in the pagination.
  * `step` (Real; optional): Page increment step.
  * `style` (Dict; optional): Defines CSS styles which will override styles previously set.
