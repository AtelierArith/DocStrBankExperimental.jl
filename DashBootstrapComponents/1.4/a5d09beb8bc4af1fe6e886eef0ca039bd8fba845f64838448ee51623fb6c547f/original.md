A Form component. The Form component can be used to organise collections of input components and apply consistent styling. Keyword arguments:

  * `children` (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional): The children of this component
  * `id` (String; optional): The ID of this component, used to identify dash components

in callbacks. The ID needs to be unique across all of the components in an app.

  * `action` (String; optional): The URI of a program that processes the information submitted via the form.
  * `className` (String; optional): **DEPRECATED** Use `class_name` instead.

Often used with CSS to style elements with common properties.

  * `class_name` (String; optional): Often used with CSS to style elements with common properties.
  * `key` (String; optional): A unique identifier for the component, used to improve

performance by React.js while rendering components See https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html for more info

  * `loading_state` (optional): Object that holds the loading state object coming from dash-renderer. loading*state has the following type: lists containing elements 'is*loading', 'prop*name', 'component*name'.

Those elements have the following types:

  * `is_loading` (Bool; optional): Determines if the component is loading or not
  * `prop_name` (String; optional): Holds which property is loading
  * `component_name` (String; optional): Holds the name of the component that is loading
  * `method` (a value equal to: 'GET', 'POST'; optional): Defines which HTTP method to use when submitting the form. Can be GET

(default) or POST.

  * `n_submit` (Real; optional): Number of times the `Enter` key was pressed while the input had focus.
  * `n_submit_timestamp` (Real; optional): Last time that `Enter` was pressed.
  * `prevent_default_on_submit` (Bool; optional): The form calls preventDefault on submit events. If you want form data to

be posted to the endpoint specified by `action` on submit events, set prevent*default*on_submit to False. Defaults to True.

  * `style` (Dict; optional): Defines CSS styles which will override styles previously set.
