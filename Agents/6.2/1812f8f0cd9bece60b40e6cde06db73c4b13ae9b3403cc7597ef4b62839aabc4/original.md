```
random_agent_in_position(pos, model::ABM, [f, alloc = false]) â†’ agent
```

Return a random agent in the position specified in `pos`.

A filter function `f(agent)` can be passed so that to restrict the sampling on only those agents for which the function returns `true`. The argument `alloc` can be used if the filtering condition is expensive since in this case the allocating version can be more performant. `nothing` is returned if no nearby position satisfies `f`.

Use [`random_nearby_agent`](@ref) instead to return a random agent near the position of a given `agent`.
