A `Branch` is a Node with parents (args).

Fields: val::T - the value of this node produced in the forward pass. f - the function used to generate this Node. args - Values indicating which elements in the tape will require updating by this node. tape - The Tape to which this Branch is assigned. pos - the location of this Branch in the tape to which it is assigned. pullback::B - if there is a custom primative rule (a `ChainRulesCore.rrule`) then this holds     the pullback to propagate gradients back through the operation. If there is not a rule     then this is set to `nothing`.     It may also be set to `nothing` by legacy Nabla rules that have not moved to ChainRules.
