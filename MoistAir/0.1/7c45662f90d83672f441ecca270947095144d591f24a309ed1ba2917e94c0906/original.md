Type used to model moist air

This uses the formulations presente in the ASHRAE handbook Psychrometrics: Theory and Practice, reference [5]. 

The temperature range is `173.15 < T < 474.15 K` with pressures `P < 5 MPa`.

It should be noted that the specific enthalpy, entropy and volume are calculated with respect to the mass of dry air. Therefore, 1 J/kg is actually 1 J per kg of dry air.
