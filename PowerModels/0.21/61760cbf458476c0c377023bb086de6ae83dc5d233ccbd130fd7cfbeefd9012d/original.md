Adds the voltage variables required to represent the voltage magnitude.

This function is an analog to `variable_bus_voltage`, which adds the variables to represent both the voltage magnitude and voltage angle.

In contrast to `variable_bus_voltage_magnitude`, this function is formulation agnostic.
