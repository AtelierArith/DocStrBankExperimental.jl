It incorporates a new atomic number correction and an absorption 	correction based upon Bishop's model (1974). Unlike earlier treatments the model does not have to 	rely upon any empirical optimisation of input parameters. The correction procedure has been tested by 	applying it to a wide range of microanalysis data including light-element results, and it is shown to 	give greater accuracy than the established methods.} }
