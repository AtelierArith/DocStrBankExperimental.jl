```
proceed(sps::AbstractVector{<:StatsSpec}; kwargs...)
```

Conduct the procedures for the [`StatsSpec`](@ref)s in `sps` while trying to avoid repeating identical steps for the [`StatsSpec`](@ref)s. See also [`@specset`](@ref).

# Keywords

  * `verbose::Union{Bool,IO}=false`: print the name of each step to `stdout` or the specified `IO` stream when it is called.
  * `keep=nothing`: names (of type `Symbol`) of additional objects to be returned.
  * `keepall::Bool=false`: return all objects generated by procedures along with arguments from the [`StatsSpec`](@ref)s.
  * `pause::Int=0`: break the iteration over [`StatsStep`](@ref)s after finishing the specified number of steps (for debugging).

# Returns

  * `Vector`: results for each specification in the same order of `sps`.

By default, either a dedicated result object for the corresponding procedure or the last value returned by the last [`StatsStep`](@ref) becomes an element in the returned `Vector` for each [`StatsSpec`](@ref). When either `keep` or `keepall` is specified, a `NamedTuple` with additional objects is formed for each [`StatsSpec`](@ref).
