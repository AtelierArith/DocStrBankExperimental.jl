Cannonball Fixed SRP Model struct Contains information to compute the reflectivity coefficient of a cannonball drag model with a  fixed reflectivity coefficient.

# Fields

  * `radius::Number`: The radius of the spacecraft.
  * `mass::Number`: The mass of the spacecraft.
  * `reflectivity_coeff::Number`: The reflectivity coefficient of the spacecraft.
  * `reflectivity_ballistic_coeff::Number`: The fixed ballistic coefficient to use.
