Cannonball Fixed Drag Model struct Contains information to compute the ballistic coefficient of a cannonball drag model with a  fixed ballistic coefficient.

# Fields

  * `radius::Number`: The radius of the spacecraft.
  * `mass::Number`: The mass of the spacecraft.
  * `drag_coeff::Number`: The drag coefficient of the spacecraft.
  * `ballistic_coeff::Number`: The fixed ballistic coefficient to use.
