```
PDFLaTeX
```

The `pdflatex` engine.

Command line options `-output-format=dvi`, `-quiet`, and `-halt-on-error` are passed to the `pdflatex` executable, and both the input and output directories are also handled. If you would like to pass additional command line arguments, use the [`latexsvg`](@ref) function.
