```
LuaLaTeX
```

The `lualatex` engine.

Command line options `--output-format=dvi`, `--interaction=batchmode`, and `--halt-on-error` are passed to the `lualatex` executable, and both the input and output directories are also handled. If you would like to pass additional command line arguments, use the [`latexsvg`](@ref) function.
