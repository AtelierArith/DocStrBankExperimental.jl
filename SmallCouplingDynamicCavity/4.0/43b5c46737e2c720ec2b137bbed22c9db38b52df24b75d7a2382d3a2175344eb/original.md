```
struct SIS <: InfectionModel
    εᵢᵗ::Array{Float64, 2} # Autoinfection probabilities
    rᵢᵗ::Array{Float64, 2} # Recovery probabilities
end
```

The `SIS` struct represents the SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) infection model.

# Fields

  * `εᵢᵗ`: An NVxT array representing the self-infection probabilities over time, where NV is the number of nodes and T is the number of time-steps. Each element εᵢᵗ[i, t] denotes the probability of node i infecting itself at time t.
  * `rᵢᵗ`: An NVxT array representing the recovery probabilities over time, where NV is the number of nodes and T is the number of time-steps. Each element rᵢᵗ[i, t] denotes the probability of node i recovering from infection at time t.
