Camera centered over all vehicles.

By default, the scene is tracked in x and y direction and the zoom level  is adapted to fit all vehicles in the scene. Tracking in either direction can be disabled by setting the `x` or `y` keys to a desired value. The zoom level can be fixed by passing a value to `zoom`. The value of `padding` specifies the width of the additional border around the zoomed-in area.
