GlobalMeanEBM
```

Submodule of `ConceptualClimateModels` which provides processes useful in creating global mean energy balance models. It is inspired by Budyko-Sellers-Ghil type models (without the latitudinal dependence). The mean does not have to be global, it can be hemispheric, or for other smaller regions.
