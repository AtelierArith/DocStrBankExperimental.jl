```
amplitude(model, p)
```

Computes the visibility amplitude of model `m` at the coordinate `p`. The coordinate `p` is expected to have the properties `U`, `V`, and sometimes `Ti` and `Fr`.

If you want to compute the amplitudemap at a large number of positions consider using the `amplitudemap` function.
