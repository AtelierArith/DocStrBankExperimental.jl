```
kern = spacekernel(kernfft, axs; rfftsz=0)
```

Return a real-space representation of `kernfft`, the frequency-space representation of a kernel. This performs an inverse Fourier transform, implicitly imposes periodic boundary conditions, and then trims & truncates axes of the output to `axs`. By default `kernfft` is assumed to have been generated by `fft`; if it was instead generated by `rfft`, the specify the original size of the first dimension. (If `kernfft` was generated by [`freqkernel`](@ref), this is just `sz[1]`.)

The inverse of `spacekernel` is [`freqkernel`](@ref).
