`Kernel` is a module implementing filtering (correlation) kernels of full dimensionality. The following kernels are supported:

  * `sobel`
  * `prewitt`
  * `ando3`, `ando4`, and `ando5`
  * `scharr`
  * `bickley`
  * `gaussian`
  * `DoG` (Difference-of-Gaussian)
  * `LoG` (Laplacian-of-Gaussian)
  * `Laplacian`
  * `gabor`
  * `moffat`
