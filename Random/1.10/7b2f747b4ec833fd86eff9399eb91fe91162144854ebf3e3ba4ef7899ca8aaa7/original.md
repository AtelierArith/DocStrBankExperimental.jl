```
randn([rng=default_rng()], [T=Float64], [dims...])
```

Generate a normally-distributed random number of type `T` with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Optionally generate an array of normally-distributed random numbers. The `Base` module currently provides an implementation for the types [`Float16`](@ref), [`Float32`](@ref), and [`Float64`](@ref) (the default), and their [`Complex`](@ref) counterparts. When the type argument is complex, the values are drawn from the circularly symmetric complex normal distribution of variance 1 (corresponding to real and imaginary part having independent normal distribution with mean zero and variance `1/2`).

See also [`randn!`](@ref) to act in-place.
