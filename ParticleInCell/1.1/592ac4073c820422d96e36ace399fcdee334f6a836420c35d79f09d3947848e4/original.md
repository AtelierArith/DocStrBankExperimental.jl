```
VariableWeightSpecies(positions::Matrix, momentums::Matrix, weight::Vector charge, mass)
```

Stores the positions and momentums of particles that share a common charge and mass. Each particle can have a different weight, and the momentum space can have a larger dimension than the position space.
