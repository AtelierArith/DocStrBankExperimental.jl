The [`sc_array`](@ref) object provides a dynamic array of equal-size elements. Elements are accessed by their 0-based index. Their address may change. The number of elements (== elem_count) of the array can be changed by  sc*array*resize and sc*array*rewind. Elements can be sorted with sc*array*sort. If the array is sorted, it can be searched with sc*array*bsearch. A priority queue is implemented with pqueue_add and pqueue_pop (untested).
