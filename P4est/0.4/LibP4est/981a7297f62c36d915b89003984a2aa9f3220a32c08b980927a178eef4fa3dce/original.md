p4est_connectivity_read_inp_stream(stream, num_vertices, num_trees, vertices, tree_to_vertex)
```

Read an ABAQUS input file from a file stream.

This utility function reads a basic ABAQUS file supporting element type with the prefix C2D4, CPS4, and S4 in 2D and of type C3D8 reading them as bilinear quadrilateral and trilinear hexahedral trees respectively.

A basic 2D mesh is given below. The `*Node` section gives the vertex number and x, y, and z components for each vertex. The `*Element` section gives the 4 vertices in 2D (8 vertices in 3D) of each element in counter clockwise order. So in 2D the nodes are given as:

4 3 +–––––––––-+ | | | | | | | | | | | | +–––––––––-+ 1 2

and in 3D they are given as:

8 7 +––––––––––-+ |\ |\ | \ | \ | \ | \ | \ | \ | 5+––––––––––-+6 | | | | +––|––––––––+ | 4\ | 3 \ | \ | \ | \ | \ | \| \| +––––––––––-+ 1 2

This code can be called two ways. The first, when `vertex`==NULL and `tree_to_vertex`==NULL, is used to count the number of trees and vertices in the connectivity to be generated by the `.inp` mesh in the *stream*. The second, when `vertices`!=NULL and `tree_to_vertex`!=NULL, fill `vertices` and `tree_to_vertex`. In this case `num_vertices` and `num_trees` need to be set to the maximum number of entries allocated in `vertices` and `tree_to_vertex`.

### Parameters

  * `stream`:[in,out] file stream to read the connectivity from
  * `num_vertices`:[in,out] the number of vertices in the connectivity
  * `num_trees`:[in,out] the number of trees in the connectivity
  * `vertices`:[out] the list of `vertices` of the connectivity
  * `tree_to_vertex`:[out] the `tree_to_vertex` map of the connectivity

### Returns

0 if successful and nonzero if not

### Prototype

```c
int p4est_connectivity_read_inp_stream (FILE * stream, p4est_topidx_t * num_vertices, p4est_topidx_t * num_trees, double *vertices, p4est_topidx_t * tree_to_vertex);
```
