Information about one side of a face in the forest. If a *quad* is local (*is_ghost* is false), then its *quadid* indexes the tree's quadrant array; otherwise, it indexes the ghosts array. If the face is hanging, then the quadrants are listed in z-order. If a quadrant should be present, but it is not included in the ghost layer, then quad = NULL, is_ghost is true, and quadid = -1.
