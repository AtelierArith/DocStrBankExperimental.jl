```
along_line_angular_distance(angular_distance₁₃::Float64,
angular_distance_line3::Float64)
```

The `along_line_angular_distance` from the start `point₁` [deg] to the closest point on the great circle line to `point₃`. As input we need the `angular_distance₁₃` [deg] between `point₁` and `point₃` [deg] and the closest distance `angular_distance_line3` [deg] between the great circle line and `point3` [deg]. The distance is non-directional.
