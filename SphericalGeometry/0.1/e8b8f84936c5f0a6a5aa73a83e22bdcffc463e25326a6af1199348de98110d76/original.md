A Julia Package for handling Spherical Geometry.

It includes the calculation of:

  * The distance to a point, line, arc, multi-arc, or polygon border
  * The intersection points between lines, arcs, multi-arcs, and polygon borders.
  * The self intersection points of multi-arcs and polygon borders

And testing if:

  * a point, arc or multi-arc is inside a polygon
  * a point is on a line, arc, multi-arc or polygon border
