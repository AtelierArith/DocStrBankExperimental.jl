```
intermediate_point(point₁::Point, point₂::Point, fraction::Float64)
```

Return the `intermediate_point` [deg] at any `fraction` along the great circle line section between the two points `point₁` and `point₂` [deg]. The fraction along the great circle line section is such that `fraction` = 0.0 is at `point₁` [deg] and `fraction` 1.0 is at `point₂` [deg].
