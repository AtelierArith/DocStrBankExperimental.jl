```
evaluate_mesh_function(
    mesh::Mesh,
    f::Function,
    region::Set{Boundary};
    qdim::Int64 = 1
) -> Vector{Float64}
```

Same as previous evaluate*mesh*function(...) but takes `Set{Boundary}` as mandatory argument for the relevant region, which replaces the keyword argument using `Set{Int64}`. Extracts nodes from the boundary and then passes them to the base function.
