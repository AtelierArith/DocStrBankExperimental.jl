This structure holds the information associated to an attribute of a tree. The attributes of each are stored in a key-value storage, where the key consists of the two entries (package_id,key) both being integers. The package_id serves to identify the application layer that added the attribute and the key identifies the attribute within that application layer.

All attribute info objects of one tree are stored in an array and adding a tree's att_offset entry to the tree's address yields this array. The attributes themselves are stored in an array directly behind the array of the attribute infos.
