`R2` is the $R^2$ of the regression. Labels default to:

  * "R2" for `AbstractAscii`
  * "$R^2$" for `AbstractLatex`
  * "<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>" for `AbstractHtml`

!!! note
    The label for `R2` is used in other related statistics. So changing the label for `R2` will change the label for other $R^2$ statistics as well.
