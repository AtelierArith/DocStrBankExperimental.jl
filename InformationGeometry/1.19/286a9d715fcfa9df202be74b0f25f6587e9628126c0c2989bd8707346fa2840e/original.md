OrthVF!(du::AbstractVector, DM::DataModel, Î¸::AbstractVector{<:Number}; ADmode::Val=Val(:ForwardDiff)) -> Vector
```

Calculates a direction (in parameter space) in which the value of the log-likelihood does not change, given a parameter configuration $\theta$. `ADmode=Val(false)` computes the Score by separately evaluating the `model` as well as the Jacobian `dmodel` provided in `DM`. Other choices of `ADmode` directly compute the Score by differentiating the formula the log-likelihood, i.e. only one evaluation on a dual variable is performed.
