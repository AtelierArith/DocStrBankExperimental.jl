```
Plane(P::AbstractVector, Vx::AbstractVector, Vy::AbstractVector)
```

Specifies a 2D plane in the so-called parameter form using 3 vectors. Here the first argument `P` is a vector on the plane, the two vectors `Vx` and `Vy` are two other vectors, which span the plane and should ideally be orthogonal.
