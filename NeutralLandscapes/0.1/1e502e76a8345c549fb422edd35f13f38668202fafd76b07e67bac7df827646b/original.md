SpatiotemporallyAutocorrelatedUpdater{SU,R,V}
```

A `NeutralLandscapeUpdater` that has a prescribed level of spatial and temporal variation (`variability`) and rate of change (`rate`), and where the spatial distribution of this change is proportional to a neutral landscape generated with `spatialupdater` at every time step. 

TODO: perhaps spatial and temporal should each have their own variability param
