```
SpatiallyAutocorrelatedUpdater{SU,R,V}
```

A `NeutralLandscapeUpdater` that has a prescribed level of  spatial variation (`variability`) and rate of change (`rate`), and where the spatial distribution of this change is proportional to a neutral landscape generated with `spatialupdater` at every time step. 

TODO: make it possible to fix a given spatial updater at each timestep.
