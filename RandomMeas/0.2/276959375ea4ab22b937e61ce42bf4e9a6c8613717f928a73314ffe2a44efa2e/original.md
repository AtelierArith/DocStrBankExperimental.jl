```
get_average_mps(ψ_list::Vector{MPS}, χ::Int64, nsweeps::Int64)
```

Approximate the average state σ from a collection of MPS using a DMRG-like algorithm.

The algorithm finds an MPS ψ (with maximum bond dimension χ) that approximates the average state σ = Average(ψ_list). To monitor convergence, it tracks a cost function defined as:

```
cost_function = ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ - ⟨ψ|σ⟩ - ⟨σ|ψ⟩,
```

which is equivalent to (||σ - ψ||² - ⟨σ|σ⟩).

# Arguments

  * `ψ_list::Vector{MPS}`: A vector of MPS objects representing individual quantum states.
  * `χ::Int64`: The desired maximum bond dimension for the averaged MPS.
  * `nsweeps::Int64`: The number of sweeps (iterations) to perform in the DMRG-like algorithm.

# Returns

An MPS representing the approximate average state with bond dimension χ.

# Example

```julia
avg_state = get_average_mps(ψ_list, 20, 10)
```
