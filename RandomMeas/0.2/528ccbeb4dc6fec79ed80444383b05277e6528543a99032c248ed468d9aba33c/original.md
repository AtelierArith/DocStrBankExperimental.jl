```
LocalUnitaryMeasurementSetting(ms::LocalUnitaryMeasurementSetting;
                                N=ms.N,
                                local_unitary=ms.local_unitary,
                                site_indices=ms.site_indices)
```

Make a new `LocalUnitaryMeasurementSetting` by copying fields from `ms`, but overriding any that you pass by keyword.
