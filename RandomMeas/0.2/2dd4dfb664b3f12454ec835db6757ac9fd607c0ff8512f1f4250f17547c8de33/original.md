```
ComputationalBasisMeasurementSetting(ms::ComputationalBasisMeasurementSetting;
                                    N=ms.N,
                                    local_unitary=ms.local_unitary,
                                    site_indices=ms.site_indices)
```

Make a new `ComputationalBasisMeasurementSetting` by copying fields from `ms`, but overriding any that you pass by keyword.
