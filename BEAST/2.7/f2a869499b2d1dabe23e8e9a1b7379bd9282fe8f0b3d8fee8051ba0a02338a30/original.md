Operator to compute the far field of a current distribution in the time domain. In particular, given the current distribution $j$ this operator allows for the computation of

$$
R =  ̂x ⋅ y
ffd = n × ∫_Γ j(r', t - R/c} dy
$$

where $̂x$ is the unit vector in the direction of observation. Note that the assembly routing expects the observation directions to be normalised by the caller.
