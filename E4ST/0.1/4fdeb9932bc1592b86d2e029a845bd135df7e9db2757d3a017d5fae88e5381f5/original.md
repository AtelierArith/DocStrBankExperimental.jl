summarize_config() -> summary::DataFrame
```

Summarizes the `config`, with columns for:

  * `name` - the property name, i.e. key
  * `required` - whether or not the property is required
  * `default` - default value of this property
  * `description`

This folder doesn't necessarily need to exist.  The code will make it for you if it doesn't exist yet.

This is to prevent processes from overwriting one another.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
