`Ultraspherical(λ)` is the space spanned by the ultraspherical polynomials

```
    C_0^{(λ)}(x),C_1^{(λ)}(x),C_2^{(λ)}(x),…
```

Note that `λ=1` this reduces to Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind: `C_k^{(1)}(x) = U_k(x)`. For `λ=1/2` this also reduces to Legendre polynomials: `C_k^{(1/2)}(x) = P_k(x)`.
