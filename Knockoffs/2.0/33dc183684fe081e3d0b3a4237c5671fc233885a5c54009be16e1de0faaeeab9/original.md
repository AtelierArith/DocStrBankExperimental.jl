Genotype states are index pairs (ka, kb) where ka, kb is unordered haplotype 1 and 2.  If there are K=5 haplotype motifs, then the 15 possible genotype states and their index are

(1, 1) = 1 (1, 2) = 2     (2, 2) = 6 (1, 3) = 3     (2, 3) = 7     (3, 3) = 10 (1, 4) = 4     (2, 4) = 8     (3, 4) = 11     (4, 4) = 13 (1, 5) = 5     (2, 5) = 9     (3, 5) = 12     (4, 5) = 14     (5, 5) = 15
