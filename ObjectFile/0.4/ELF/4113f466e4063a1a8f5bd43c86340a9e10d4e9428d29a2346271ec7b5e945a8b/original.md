Collect all version definitions from .gnu.version*d.  This section contains a sequence of verdef structs `vd`, each of which owns exactly `vd.vd*cnt`verdaux structs which we convert to names.  The first name is generally the only important one to the given`vd`; it is the version being defined, and corresponds to`vd.vd*hash`.  If present, a second verdaux usually notes the parent version (e.g.`names = ["GLIBCXX*3.4.7", "GLIBCXX_3.4.6"]`)
