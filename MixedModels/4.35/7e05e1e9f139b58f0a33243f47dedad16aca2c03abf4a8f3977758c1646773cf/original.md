ReMat{T,S} <: AbstractMatrix{T}
```

A section of a model matrix generated by a random-effects term.

# Fields

  * `trm`: the grouping factor as a `StatsModels.CategoricalTerm`
  * `refs`: indices into the levels of the grouping factor as a `Vector{Int32}`
  * `levels`: the levels of the grouping factor
  * `cnames`: the names of the columns of the model matrix generated by the left-hand side of the term
  * `z`: transpose of the model matrix generated by the left-hand side of the term
  * `wtz`: a weighted copy of `z` (`z` and `wtz` are the same object for unweighted cases)
  * `λ`: a `LowerTriangular` or `Diagonal` matrix of size `S×S`
  * `inds`: a `Vector{Int}` of linear indices of the potential nonzeros in `λ`
  * `adjA`: the adjoint of the matrix as a `SparseMatrixCSC{T}`
  * `scratch`: a `Matrix{T}`
