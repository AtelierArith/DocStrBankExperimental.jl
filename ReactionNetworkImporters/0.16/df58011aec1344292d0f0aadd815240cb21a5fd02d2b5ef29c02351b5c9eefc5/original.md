Given substrate and product stoichiometric matrices, rate-expressions and lists of species and parameters, return a ReactionSystem that describes the chemical reaction network.

Assumed that the substrate and product stoichiometry matrices are stored as numspecies by numrxs matrices, with entry (i,j) giving the stoichiometric coefficient of species i within rx j.
