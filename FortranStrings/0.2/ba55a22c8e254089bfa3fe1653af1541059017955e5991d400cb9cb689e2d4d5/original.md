```
INDEX(STRING, SUBSTRING, BACK=false)
```

Return the position of the start of the first occurrence of string `SUBSTRING` as a substring in `STRING`, counting from one.

If `SUBSTRING` is not present in `STRING`, zero is returned. If the `BACK` argument is present and true, the return value is the start of the last occurrence rather than the first.
