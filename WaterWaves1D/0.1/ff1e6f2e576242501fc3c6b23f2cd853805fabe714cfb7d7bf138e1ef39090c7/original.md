```
Random(param;args)
```

Randomly generated initial data, based on provided (optional arguments) :

  * `L` is the typical wavelength (default is `L=1`),
  * `s` is the (real) Sobolev index regularity (default is `s=∞`),
  * `λ` is the length of spatial localization (default is `λ=∞`, no localization),
  * `a` is the couple of amplitudes of the surface deformation, and velocity (default is `a=(1,1)`).

Return an initial data `init::InitialData`,  to be used in initial-value problems `Problem(model, init, param)`, with `init.η` and `init.v` two samples of `random(x;L,s,λ)`, where `x` is the set of collocation points generated by `Mesh(param)`.
