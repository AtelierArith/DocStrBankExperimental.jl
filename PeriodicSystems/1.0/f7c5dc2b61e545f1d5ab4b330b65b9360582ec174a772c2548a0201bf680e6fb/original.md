Compute the finite and infinite zeros of a continuous-time periodic system `psys = (A(t), B(t), C(t), D(t))` in `val`,  where the periodic system matrices `A(t)`, `B(t)`, `C(t)`, and `D(t)` are in a *Harmonic Array*, or  *Periodic Function Matrix*, or *Periodic Symbolic Matrix* representation  (the last two representation are automatically converted to a *Harmonic Array* representation).  `N` is the number of selected harmonic components in the Fourier series of the system matrices (default: `N = max(20,nh-1)`,  where `nh` is the maximum number of harmonics terms) and the keyword parameter `P` is the number of full periods  to be considered (default: `P = 1`) to build  a frequency-lifted LTI representation based on truncated block Toeplitz matrices. 

The computation of the zeros of the *complex* lifted system is performed by reducing the corresponding system pencil  to an appropriate Kronecker-like form which exhibits the finite and infinite eigenvalues.  The reduction is performed using orthonal similarity transformations and involves rank decisions based on rank revealing QR-decompositions with column pivoting,  if `fast = true`, or, the more reliable, SVD-decompositions, if `fast = false`. For a system `psys` of period `T`,  the finite zeros are determined as those eigenvalues which have imaginary parts in the interval `[-ω/2, ω/2]`, where `ω = 2π/(P*T)`. To eliminate possible spurious finite eigenvalues, the intersection of two finite eigenvalue sets is computed  for two lifted systems obtained for `N` and `N+2` harmonic components.     The infinite zeros are determined as the infinite zeros of the LTI system `(A(ti), B(ti), C(ti), D(ti))`  resulting for a random time value `ti`. *Warning:* While this evaluation of the number of infinite zeros mostly  provides the correct result, there is no theoretical assessment of this approach (counterexamples are welcome!). 

The keyword arguments `atol`  and `rtol` specify the absolute and relative tolerances for the nonzero elements of the underlying lifted system pencil, respectively.  The default relative tolerance is `n*ϵ`, where `n` is the size of the smallest dimension of the pencil, and `ϵ` is the  working machine epsilon.
