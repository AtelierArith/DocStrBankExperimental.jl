```
key = makekey(requested,requestable)
```

Create a "key" i.e. a data structure of indices into an array `out` of internal results, returned by the code generated by `@espy`. 

Inputs are

  * `requested` a data structure defining a request. This input is provided  by the user of the code to specify what results are to be extracted.
  * `requestable` a named tuple defining the names and sizes of intermediate results  that can be requested from a given function: this input is provided

# Example

```
requestable  = (gp=forloop(2, (z=scalar,s=scalar, material=(a=scalar,b=scalar))),)
requested    = @request gp[].(s,z,material.(a,b))
key,nkey     = makekey(requested,requestable)
```

returns `key` such that

```
key.gp[1] == (s=1, z=2, material = (a=3, b=4))
key.gp[2] == (s=5, z=6, material = (a=7, b=8))
key.gp[2].material.a == 7
nkey      == 8
```
