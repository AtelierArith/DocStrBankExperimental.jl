```
Piece
```

Type representing a chess piece.

The possible values are `PIECE_WP`, `PIECE_WN`, `PIECE_WB`, `PIECE_WR`, `PIECE_WQ`, `PIECE_WK`, `PIECE_BP`, `PIECE_BN`, `PIECE_BB`, `PIECE_BR`, `PIECE_BQ`, `PIECE_BK` and `EMPTY`. The reason for the existence of the value `EMPTY` is that we represent a chess board as an array of pieces, and we need a value to indicate an empty square on the board.
