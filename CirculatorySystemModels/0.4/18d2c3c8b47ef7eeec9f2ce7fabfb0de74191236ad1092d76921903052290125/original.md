`Resistor(;name, R=1.0)`

Implements the resistor using Ohm's law to represent a vessels linear resistance to blood flow.

Parameter is in the cm, g, s system. Pressure in mmHg. `Î”p` is calculated in mmHg `q` calculated in cm^3/s (ml/s)

Named parameters:

`R`:       Resistance of the vessel to the fluid in mmHg*s/ml
