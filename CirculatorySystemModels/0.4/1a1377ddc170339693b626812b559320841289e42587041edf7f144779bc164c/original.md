`WK3E(;name, Rc=1.0, Rp=1.0, E=1.0)`

Implements the 3 element windkessel model. With a vessel elastance instead of a capacitor.

Parameters are in the cm, g, s system. Pressure in mmHg. Volume in ml. Flow in cm^3/s (ml/s)

Named parameters:

`Rc`:      Characteristic impedance in mmHg*s/ml

`Rp`:      Peripheral resistance in mmHg*s/ml

`E`:       Arterial elastance in mmHg/ml
