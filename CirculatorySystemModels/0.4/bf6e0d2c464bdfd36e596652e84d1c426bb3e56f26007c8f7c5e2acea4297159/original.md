`RRCR(;name, R1=1.0, R2=1.0, R3=1.0, C=1.0)`

Implements the resistor, resistor, compliance, resistor subsystem.

Parameters are in the cm, g, s system. Pressure in mmHg. Volume in ml. Flow in cm^3/s (ml/s).

Named parameters:

`R1`:      Component resistance in mmHg*s/ml

`R2`:      Component resistance in mmHg*s/ml

`C`:       Component compliance in ml/mmHg

`R3`:      Component resistance in mmHg*s/ml
