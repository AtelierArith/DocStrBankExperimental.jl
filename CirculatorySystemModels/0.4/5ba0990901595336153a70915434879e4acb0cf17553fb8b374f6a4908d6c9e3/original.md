`PoiseuilleResistor(;name, μ=3e-2, r=0.5, L=5)`

Implements the resistance following the Poiseuille law.

Parameters are in the cm, g, s system. Pressures in mmHg. `Δp` is calculated in mmHg, `q` is calculated in cm^3/s (ml/s).

Named parameters:

`μ`:       viscosity of fluid in dyne s / cm^2

`r`:       radius of vessel segmenty in cm

`L`:       length of vessel segment in cm
