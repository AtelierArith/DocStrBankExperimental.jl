`QResistor(;name, K=1.0)`

Implements the quadratic resistor to represent a vessels non-linear resistance to blood flow.

Parameters are in the cm, g, s system. Pressures in mmHg. `Î”p` is calculated in mmHg, `q` is calculated in cm^3/s (ml/s).

Named parameters:

`K`: non-linear resistance of the vessel to the fluid in mmHg*s^2/ml^2
