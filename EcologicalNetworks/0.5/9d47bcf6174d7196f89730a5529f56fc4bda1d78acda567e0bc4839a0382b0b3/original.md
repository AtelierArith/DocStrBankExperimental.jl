Q(N::T, L::Dict{E,Int64}) where {T<:AbstractEcologicalNetwork,E}
```

Modularity of a network and its partition. The second argument is a dictionary where every species of `N` is associated to an `Int64` value representing the identity of the module. This function returns the same value of bipartite networks and their unipartite projection.
