null2(N::BinaryNetwork)
```

Given a network `N`, `null2(N)` returns a network with the same dimensions, where every interaction happens with a probability equal to the degree of each species.

Note that this does not guarantee that the network is not degenerate, so the output of this analysis *should* be filtered using `is_degenerate`, or passed to `simplify`. The output of this approach is *always* a probabilistic network of the same partiteness as the original network.
