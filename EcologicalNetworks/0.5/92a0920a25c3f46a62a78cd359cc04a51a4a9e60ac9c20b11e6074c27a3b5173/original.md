Compute the zero-one-out version of the linear filter (`linearfilter`), i.e. the score for each interaction if that interaction would not occur in the network. For example, if N[4, 6] = 1 (interaction between species 4 and 6), the result at postion (4, 6) is the score of the filter using a network in which that interaction did not occur. This function is useful for validating the filter whether it can detect false negative (missing) interactions.
