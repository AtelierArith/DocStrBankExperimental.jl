Construct a KeyCombination instance from a string as `"[<state_1>+[...<state_n>+]]<key>"`. The string must be a list of elements separated by '+' characters, with only one key symbol at the end. For example, `"k"`, `"alt+k"` and `"ctrl+alt+shift+f11"` are valid strings, but `"k+a"` is not. Casing is significant, as `z` and `Z` are different key symbols. For modifier strings, the casing should be lowercase, or will be forcefully converted into a lowercase string (reducing performance).
