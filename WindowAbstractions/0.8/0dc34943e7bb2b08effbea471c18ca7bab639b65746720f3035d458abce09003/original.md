```
replay_history(wm, events)
```

Replay events generated by [`save_history`](@ref) on the provided window manager.

Delays between events should be respected. The window manager is free to assume that no other event will be generated during the replay: user interactinos with the window while the replay is ongoing may affect the integrity of the replication.

Note that any global state such as RNG is not saved; the application is responsible for managing state appropriately for effects outside of the event system.
