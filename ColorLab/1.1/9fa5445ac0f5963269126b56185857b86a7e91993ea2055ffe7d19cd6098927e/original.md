CAM16 Viewing Conditions

W: White in test illuminant [Xw, Yw, Zw] Yb: Background in test conditions La: Luminance of test adapting field (cd/m2) Surround: Surround condition {Average, Dim, Dark}, Nc and F are functions of c, and their values can be linearly interpolated.           Sr = Lsw / Ldw, where Lsw is the luminance of reference white in surround and Ldw in the display area.           Sr == 0: Dark           0 < Sr < 0.2: Dim           Sr >= 0.2: Average
