Intersection point of a line and a plane. points of a line are defined as a direction(Dₗ) through a point(Pₗ): P = Pₗ + λDₗ , where λ is a scaler. points of a plane are defined as a plane through a point(Pₚ) and with normal vector(Nₚ) : Nₚᵀ(P - Pₚ) = 0 , where Nᵀ is the transpose of N.

return the point of intersection and if it's on direction.
