```
unwind(iterators...)
```

Represent all possible combinations of values generated by `iterators` as rows of a matrix `A`. In more detail, `A` has one column for each iterator in `iterators` and one row for each distinct possible combination of values taken on by the iterators. Elements in the first column cycle fastest, those in the last clolumn slowest.

### Example

```julia-repl
julia> iterators = ([1, 2], ["a","b"], ["x", "y", "z"]);
julia> MLJTuning.unwind(iterators...)
12Ã—3 Matrix{Any}:
 1  "a"  "x"
 2  "a"  "x"
 1  "b"  "x"
 2  "b"  "x"
 1  "a"  "y"
 2  "a"  "y"
 1  "b"  "y"
 2  "b"  "y"
 1  "a"  "z"
 2  "a"  "z"
 1  "b"  "z"
 2  "b"  "z"
```
