Calculate the logarithmic negativity of a density operator partition, defined as

$$
N(\rho) = \log\|\rho^{T_B}\|_1
$$

wherein $\rho^{T_B}$ denotes partial transposition as per the partition and $\|\bullet\|_1$ is the trace norm.

Consult specific implementation for function arguments and logarithmic basis.
