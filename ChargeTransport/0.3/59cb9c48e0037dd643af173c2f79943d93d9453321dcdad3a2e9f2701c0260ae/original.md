Abstract type for generalized Scharfetter-Gummel flux discretization. This flux approximation results in an implicit equation which needs to be solved and is exact for all Blakemore type statistics functions with abritary γ, check T. Koprucki and K. Gärtner. “Discretization scheme for drift-diffusion equations with strong diffusion enhancement”.
