`IndividualsSelector` that implements a "trivial geography" similar to Spector and Kline (2006) by first sampling an individual randomly and then selecting additional individuals for the same tournament within a certain deme of limited size (`radius`) for the sub-sequent individuals in the population.

The version we implement here is from:     I. Harvey, "The Microbial Genetic Algorithm", in Advances in Artificial Life     Darwin Meets von Neumann, Springer, 2011. The original paper is:     Spector, L., and J. Klein. 2005. Trivial Geography in Genetic Programming.     In Genetic Programming Theory and Practice III, edited by T. Yu, R.L. Riolo,     and B. Worzel, pp. 109-124. Boston, MA: Kluwer Academic Publishers.     http://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/pubs/trivial-geography-toappear.pdf
