Mutation clock operator is a more efficient way to mutate vectors than to generate a random value per variable in the vectors. It instead generates the number of variables to skip until the next mutation. Then it uses a sub-mutation operator to do the actual mutation. This is based on the paper:     Deb and Deb (2012), "Analyzing Mutation Schemes for Real-Parameter Genetic Algorithms" but we use a Poisson distribution.
