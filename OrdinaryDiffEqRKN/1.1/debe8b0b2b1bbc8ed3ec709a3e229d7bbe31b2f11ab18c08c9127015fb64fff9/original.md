3 stage fourth order Runge-Kutta Nystrom method to solve second order linear inhomogeneous IVPs.

Does not include an adaptive method. Solves for for d-dimensional differential systems of second order linear inhomogeneous equations.

!!! warn
    This method is only fourth order for these systems, the method is second order otherwise!
