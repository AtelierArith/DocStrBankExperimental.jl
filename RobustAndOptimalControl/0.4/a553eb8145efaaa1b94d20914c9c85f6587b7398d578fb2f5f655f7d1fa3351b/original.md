Compute the a balanced truncation of order `n` and the hankel singular values

For keyword arguments, see the docstring of `DescriptorSystems.gbalmr`, reproduced below Base.Docs.DocStr(svec("    gbalmr(sys, balance = false, matchdc = false, ord = missing, offset = √ϵ,\n           atolhsv = 0, rtolhsv = nϵ, atolmin = atolhsv, rtolmin = rtolhsv, \n           atol = 0, atol1 = atol, atol2 = atol, rtol, fast = true) -> (sysr, hs)\n\nCompute for a proper and stable descriptor system `sys = (A-λE,B,C,D)` with the transfer function\nmatrix `G(λ)`, a reduced order realization `sysr = (Ar-λEr,Br,Cr,Dr)` and the vector `hs` of decreasingly \nordered Hankel singular values of the system `sys`. If `balance = true`, a balancing-based approach\nis used to determine a reduced order minimal realization \nof the form `sysr = (Ar-λI,Br,Cr,Dr)`. For a continuous-time system `sys`, the resulting realization `sysr`\nis balanced, i.e., the controllability and observability grammians are equal and diagonal. \nIf additonally `matchdc = true`, the resulting `sysr` is computed using state rezidualization formulas \n(also known as *singular perturbation approximation*) which additionally preserves the DC-gain of `sys`. \nIn this case, the resulting realization `sysr` is balanced (for both continuous- and discrete-time systems).\nIf `balance = false`, an enhanced accuracy balancing-free approach is used to determine the \nreduced order system `sysr`. \n\nIf `ord = nr`, the resulting order of `sysr` is `min(nr,nrmin)`, where `nrmin` is the order of a minimal  \nrealization of `sys` determined as the number of Hankel singular values exceeding `max(atolmin,rtolmin*HN)`, with\n`HN`, the Hankel norm of `G(λ)`. If `ord = missing`, the resulting order is chosen as the number of Hankel \nsingular values exceeding `max(atolhsv,rtolhsv*HN)`. \n\nTo check the stability of the eigenvalues of the pencil `A-λE`, the real parts of eigenvalues must be less than `-β`\nfor a continuous-time system or \nthe moduli of eigenvalues must be less than `1-β` for a discrete-time system, where `β` is the stability domain boundary offset.  \nThe offset  `β` to be used can be specified via the keyword parameter `offset = β`. \nThe default value used for `β` is `sqrt(ϵ)`, where `ϵ` is the working machine precision. \n\nThe keyword arguments `atol1`, `atol2`, and `rtol`, specify, respectively, \nthe absolute tolerance for the nonzero elements of `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`,  \nthe absolute tolerance for the nonzero elements of `E`,  \nand the relative tolerance for the nonzero elements of `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` and `E`.  \nThe default relative tolerance is `nϵ`, where `ϵ` is the working *machine epsilon* \nand `n` is the order of the system `sys`. The keyword argument `atol` can be used \nto simultaneously set `atol1 = atol` and `atol2 = atol`. \n\nIf `E` is singular, the uncontrollable infinite eigenvalues of the pair `(A,E)` and\nthe non-dynamic modes are elliminated using minimal realization techniques.\nThe rank determinations in the performed reductions\nare based on rank revealing QR-decompositions with column pivoting \nif `fast = true` or the more reliable SVD-decompositions if `fast = false`. \n\nMethod:  For the order reduction of a standard system, the balancing-free method of [1] or \nthe balancing-based method of [2] are used. For a descriptor system the balancing related order reduction \nmethods of [3] are used. To preserve the DC-gain of the original system, the singular perturbation \napproximation method of [4] is used in conjunction with the balancing-based or balancing-free\napproach of [5]. \n\nReferences\n\n[1] A.
