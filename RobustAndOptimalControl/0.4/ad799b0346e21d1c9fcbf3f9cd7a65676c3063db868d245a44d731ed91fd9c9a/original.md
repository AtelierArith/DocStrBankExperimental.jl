Compute the ν-gap metric between two systems. See also [`ncfmargin`](@ref).

For keyword arguments, see the docstring of `DescriptorSystems.gnugap`, reproduced below Base.Docs.DocStr(svec("   \n    gnugap(sys1, sys2; freq = ω, rtolinf = 0.00001, fast = true, offset = sqrt(ϵ), \n           atol = 0, atol1 = atol, atol2 = atol, rtol = n*ϵ) -> (nugapdist, fpeak)\n\nCompute the ν-gap distance `nugapdist` between two descriptor systems `sys1 = (A1-λE1,B1,C1,D1)` and \n`sys2 = (A2-λE2,B2,C2,D2)` and the corresponding frequency `fpeak` (in rad/TimeUnit), where the ν-gap \ndistance achieves its peak value. \n\nIf `freq = missing`, the resulting `nugapdist` satisfies `0 <= nugapdist <= 1`. \nThe value `nugapdist = 1` results, if the winding number is different of zero in which case `fpeak = []`. \n\nIf `freq = ω`, where `ω` is a given vector of real frequency values, the resulting `nugapdist` is a vector \nof pointwise ν-gap distances of the dimension of `ω`, whose components satisfies `0 <= maximum(nugapdist) <= 1`. \nIn this case, `fpeak` is the frequency for which the pointwise distance achieves its peak value. \nAll components of `nugapdist` are set to 1 if the winding number is different of zero in which case `fpeak = []`.\n\nThe stability boundary offset, `β`, to be used to assess the finite zeros which belong to the\nboundary of the stability domain can be specified via the keyword parameter `offset = β`.\nAccordingly, for a continuous-time system, these are the finite zeros having \nreal parts within the interval `[-β,β]`, while for a discrete-time system, \nthese are the finite zeros having moduli within the interval `[1-β,1+β]`. \nThe default value used for `β` is `sqrt(ϵ)`, where `ϵ` is the working machine precision. \n\nPencil reduction algorithms are employed to compute range and coimage spaces \nwhich perform rank decisions based on rank \nrevealing QR-decompositions with column pivoting \nif `fast = true` or the more reliable SVD-decompositions if `fast = false`.\n\nThe keyword arguments `atol1`, `atol2` and `rtol`, specify, respectively, \nthe absolute tolerance for the nonzero elements of `A1`, `A2`, `B1`, `B2`, `C1`, `C2`, `D1` and `D2`,\nthe absolute tolerance for the nonzero elements of `E1` and `E2`,   \nand the relative tolerance for the nonzero elements of all above matrices.  \nThe default relative tolerance is `n*ϵ`, where`ϵ`is the working machine epsilon \nand`n`is the maximum of the orders of the systems`sys1`and`sys2`. \nThe keyword argument`atol`can be used to simultaneously set`atol1 = atol`,`atol2 = atol`. \n\nThe keyword argument`rtolinf`specifies the relative accuracy to be used \nto compute the ν-gap as the infinity norm of the relevant system according to [1]. \nThe default value used for`rtolinf`is`0.00001`.\n   \n*Method:* The evaluation of ν-gap uses the definition proposed in [1],\nextended to generalized LTI (descriptor) systems. The computation of winding number\nis based on enhancements covering zeros on the boundary of the \nstability domain and infinite zeros.\n\n*References:*\n\n[1] G. Vinnicombe.
