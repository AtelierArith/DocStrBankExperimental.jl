The `Format` module provides a public interface that can be used to define custom formatters aside from the predefined HTML and LaTeX outputs supported by `Highlights`.

The [Formatting](@ref) section of the manual provides a example of how to go about extending `Highlights` to support additional output formats.

The following functions and types are exported from the module for public use:

  * [`TokenIterator`](@ref)
  * [`render`](@ref)
