```
fit(SubspaceLDA, X, y; normalize=true)
```

Fit an subspace projection of LDA model over a given data set `X` with corresponding labels `y` using the equivalent of $\mathbf{S}_w^*$ and $\mathbf{S}_b^*$`.

Note: Subspace LDA also supports the normalized version of LDA via the `normalize` keyword.
