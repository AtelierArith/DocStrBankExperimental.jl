Subspace LDA model type has following fields:

  * `projw`: the projection matrix of the subspace spanned by the between-class scatter
  * `projLDA`: the projection matrix of the subspace spanned by the within-class scatter
  * `Î»`: the projection eigenvalues
  * `cmeans`: the class centroids
  * `cweights`: the class weights
