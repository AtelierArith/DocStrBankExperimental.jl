```
groebner_with_change_matrix(polynomials; options...)
```

Computes a Groebner basis of the ideal generated by `polynomials` and emits a change matrix, that is, a map from the original generators to basis elements.

## Arguments

  * `polynomials`: an array of polynomials. Supports polynomials from   AbstractAlgebra.jl, Nemo.jl, and DynamicPolynomials.jl. For   AbstractAlgebra.jl and Nemo.jl, coefficients of polynomials must belong to   `GF(p)`, `Native.GF(p)`, or `QQ`.

## Returns

Returns a tuple (`basis`, `matrix`).

  * `basis`: an array of polynomials, a Groebner basis.
  * `matrix`: a matrix, so that `matrix * polynomials == basis`.

## Possible Options

Same as for `groebner`.

## Example

Using AbstractAlgebra.jl:

```@example
using Groebner, AbstractAlgebra
R, (x, y) = QQ["x", "y"]
f = [x*y^2 + x, y*x^2 + y]

g, m = groebner_with_change_matrix(f, ordering=DegRevLex())

@assert isgroebner(g, ordering=DegRevLex())
@assert m * f == g
```

## Notes

  * Only `DegRevLex` ordering is supported.
  * The function is thread-safe.
  * The default algorithm is probabilistic (with `certify=false`). Results are   correct with high probability, however, no precise bound on the probability   is known.
