intensity*from*rabifrequency(         laser, rabi*frequency::Real, ion, transition::Tuple, chamber::Chamber         ) Compute the intensity needed to get a certain `rabi*frequency`with a certain resonant`laser`-`ion``transition`within`chamber`, which defines the magnetic field direction.`laser`may be either a Laser or an Int indicating the desired laser's index within`chamber`.`ion`may be either an Ion or an Int indicating the desired ion's index within`chamber`.`laser`and`ion` must either both be indices or both their respective Structs.
