full_normal_mode_description(chain::LinearChain)
```

For each axis, this contains an array of tuples where the first element is a vibrational frequency [Hz] and the second element is a vector describing the participation of each ion at that vibrational frequency (i.e. the normal mode eigenvector corresponding to that  eigenfrequency).
