```
FrequencyWeights(vs, wsum=sum(vs))
```

Construct a `FrequencyWeights` vector with weight values `vs`. A precomputed sum may be provided as `wsum`.

Frequency weights describe the number of times (or frequency) each observation was observed. These weights may also be referred to as case weights or repeat weights.
