```
cumulant(v, k, [wv::AbstractWeights], m=mean(v))
```

Return the `k`th order cumulant of a real-valued array `v`, optionally specifying a weighting vector `wv` and a pre-computed mean `m`.

If `k` is a range of `Integer`s, then return all the cumulants of orders in this range as a vector.

This quantity is calculated using a recursive definition on lower-order cumulants and central moments.
