```

The initial condition that uses the dispersion relation of the Euler equations to approximate waves generated by a wave maker as it is done by experiments of Dingemans. The topography is a trapezoidal.

!!! warning "Translation of water height"
    The initial condition for the water height is translated to be around 0, which is needed for the simulation because the `BBMBBMEquations1D` are only implemented for $\eta_0 = 0$.
