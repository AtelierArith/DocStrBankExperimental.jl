The `UndirectedGraph` type represents a simple graph; that is, an undirected graph with no loops and no multiple edges.

Use `UndirectedGraph()` to create a new graph in which the vertices may be `Any` type. Use `UndirectedGraph{T}()` to create a new graph in which the vertices are of type `T`. See `IntGraph` and `StringGraph` as special cases.
