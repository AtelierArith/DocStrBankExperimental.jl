`adjacency(G)` returns the adjacency matrix of `G`.

Note: If the vertices can be sorted by `sort`, then the first row of the adjacency matrix corresponds to the first vertex (in order) in `G` and so forth. However, if the vertices are not sortable in this way, the mapping between vertices and rows/columns of the matrix is unpredictable.
