`ShiftDigraph(alphabet,n)` creates a `SimpleDigraph` whose vertices are all length-`n` tuples of the elements in `alphabet` (which can be an array such as `[0,1]` or a string such as `"abc"`). An edge from `u` to `v` corresponds to an element dropped from the first position in `u` and another element added to the end yielding `v`. For example, in `ShiftDigraph([0,1],5)` there are two edges leaving vertex `(0,1,0,1,1)`; one goes to `(1,0,1,1,0)` and the other to `(1,0,1,1,1)`.
