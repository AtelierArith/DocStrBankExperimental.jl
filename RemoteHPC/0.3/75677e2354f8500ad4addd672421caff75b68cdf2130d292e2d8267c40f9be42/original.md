Represents and execution environment, i.e. a job script for `SLURM`, `HQ`, etc. This forms the skeleton of the scripts with the scheduler directives, exports, pre and postambles, and which executable to use for parallel execution (think `mpirun`, `srun`, etc).

As with any [`Storable`](@ref), `name` is used simply as a label to be able to [`load`](@ref) it from the [`Server`](@ref) where it is stored.

# `configure()` Example

```julia
name::String = "default",
directives::Dict{Any, Any} = Dict{Any, Any}("time" => "24:00:00", "partition" => "standard", "account" => "s1073", "N" => 4, "ntasks-per-node" => 36, "cpus-per-task" => 1)
exports::Dict{Any, Any} = Dict{Any, Any}("OMP_NUM_THREADS" => 1)
preamble::String = "echo hello"
postamble::String = "echo goodbye"
parallel_exec::Exec = Exec(name="srun", path="srun", flags=Dict("n" => 36))
```

# Example

```julia
Environment(
    name = "default",
    directives = Dict("time" => "24:00:00", "partition" => "standard", "account" => "s1073", "N" => 4, "ntasks-per-node" => 36, "cpus-per-task" => 1)
    exports = Dict("OMP_NUM_THREADS" => 1)
    preamble = "echo hello"
    postamble = "echo goodbye"
    parallel_exec = Exec(name="srun", path="srun", flags=Dict("n" => 36))
)
```

Will be translated into

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generated by RemoteHPC
#SBATCH --job-name <will be filled in upon submission> 
#SBATCH --time=24:00:00
#SBATCH --partition=standard

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

<module load commands specified by Execs will go here>

echo hello

srun -n 36 <parallel Exec 1>
