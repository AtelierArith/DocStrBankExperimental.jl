Hybrid{P} <: AbstractAlgorithm{P}

A modified version of Powell's hybrid method (a trust region method with dogleg). The essentially same algorithm can solve both root-finding problems and least-squares problem. To indicate the problem type, set either `RootFinding` or `LeastSquares` as type parameter. For keyword arguments accepted by `init` and `solve` when using this algorithm, see [`HybridSolver`](@ref).
