count_moves_uniform(g, κ=nv(g) - 1) = s1, s2, (x1, y1, T1), (x2, y2, H2)
```

Counts and samples operator in polynomial-time by avoiding full enumeration (only works for uniform score.)  Count the number `s1` of Insert and `s2` of Delete operators for CPDAG `g` with  degree bound `κ` and return a uniformly selected `Insert(x1, y1, T1)``and a uniform selected`Delete(x2, y2, H2)` operator.
