```
ReadWriteLock(; kwargs...)
```

Constructs a `ReadWriteLock`, which allows multiple threads to read in parallel, but only one thread to write at a time.  This lock is designed for managing data that requires very short but frequent access times. It is particularly useful in scenarios where reading operations happen frequently and can occur simultaneously, but writing operations need to be exclusive.

# Keyword Arguments

  * `kwargs...`: Currently unused, but allows for future customization of the lockâ€™s behavior.

# Example

```julia
rw_lock = ReadWriteLock()  # Creates a new read-write lock
```

```
ReadWriteLock
```

A lock that allows one write operation at a time, while multiple read operations can be performed concurrently. This is useful for data management situations with extremely short but frequent access times.

#Fields

```
head::Threads.Atomic{Int64}: Tracks the current position in the lock queue for managing the order of operations.
tail::Threads.Atomic{Int64}: Tracks the tail of the queue, representing the most recent operation in the queue.
reads_count::Threads.Atomic{Int64}: Keeps track of the number of concurrent read operations. Only one write operation can proceed if no reads are active.
```

# This lock supports both read and write operations:

```
readlock(): Acquires a read lock, allowing multiple readers to access the data concurrently.
writelock(): Acquires a write lock, granting exclusive access to the data for writing.
readunlock(): Releases a previously acquired read lock.
writeunlock(): Releases a previously acquired write lock.
```
