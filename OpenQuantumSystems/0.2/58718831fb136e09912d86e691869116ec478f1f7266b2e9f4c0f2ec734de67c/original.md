trace_bath(rho, a, b, agg, FCProd, aggIndices, vibindices)
```

Trace out bath degrees of freedom from `rho` without the product of Franck-Condon factors. The trace will be done only on the Hilber space for electric bra part `a` and ket part `b`. Input density matrix `rho` is for the whole Hilber space. This method returns number.
