```
getAggStateEnergy(agg, aggElState, aggVibState)
```

Get Hamiltonian of the [`Aggregate`](@ref) in a form of DenseOperator.

# Arguments

  * `agg`: Instance of [`Aggregate`](@ref).
  * `aggElState`: Aggregate electric state (e.g. [1, 1, 2]).
  * `aggVibState`: Aggregate vibrational state (e.g. [[9, 1], [2, 5, 3], [10]]).
