ThickLens(;  R1, R2, t, n_lens=1.5 n1=1.0, n2=1.0)
```

Construct a thick lens with the keywords:

  * `R1` radius of curvature of first surface
  * `R2` radius of curvature of second surface
  * `t`: thickness of lens
  * `n_lens=1.5` refractive index of lens
  * `n1=1`: refractive index of the medium of the incoming side
  * `n2=1`: refractive index of the medium of the exiting side
