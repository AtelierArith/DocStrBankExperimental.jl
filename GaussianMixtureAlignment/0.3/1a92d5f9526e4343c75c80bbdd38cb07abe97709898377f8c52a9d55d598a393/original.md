# GaussianMixtureAlignment.jl

GaussianMixtureAlignment.jl is a package used to align Gaussian mixture models. In particular, it uses an implementation of the [GOGMA algorithm (Campbell, 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00150) to find globally optimal alignments of mixtures of isotropic (spherical) Gaussian distributions.
