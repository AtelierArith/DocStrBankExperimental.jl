```
Freestream([Vinf,] alpha, beta, Omega)
```

Defines the freestream and rotational velocity properties.

**Arguments**

  * `Vinf`: Freestream velocity
  * `alpha`: angle of attack (rad)
  * `beta`: sideslip angle (rad)
  * `Omega`: rotation vector (p, q, r) of the body frame about the reference center.   Uses standard coordinate system from dynamics (positve p roll right wing down to turn right, positive q is pitch nose up, positive r is yaw nose to the right)
