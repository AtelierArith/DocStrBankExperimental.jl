```
TiledView(data::F, tile_size::NTuple{N,Int}, 
          tile_overlap::NTuple{N,Int} = tile_size .* 0, 
          tile_center::NTuple{M,Int} = (mod.(tile_size,2) .+ 1)
          ; pad_value::T, keep_center=true)
```

Creates an 2N dimensional view of the data by tiling the N-dimensional data as  specified by tile*size, tile*overlap and optionally tile_center.

## Arguments

  * `data`: the input data to decompose into a TiledView. No copies are made for the `TiledView` and the raw data can be accessed via `.parent`.
  * `tile_size`: A Tuple describing the size of each tile. This size will form the first N dimensions of the result of `size(myview)`. The second N dimensions refer to N-dimensional tile numbering.
  * `tile_overlap`: Tuple specifying the overlap between successive tiles in voxels. This implicitely defines the pitch between tiles as `(tile_size .- tile_overlap)`.

## Keyword Argument

  * `pad_value`: Specifies the answer that is returned when get_index is applied to a position outside the source array.
  * `keep_center`:  This boolean specifies whether the center of the parent `data` will be aligned with the center of the central tile. If `false`, the first tile starts at offset zero.
  * `tile_center`:  Only used if `keep_center` is true. It defines the center position in the central tile. The default is `tile_size .รท 2 .+1`.
