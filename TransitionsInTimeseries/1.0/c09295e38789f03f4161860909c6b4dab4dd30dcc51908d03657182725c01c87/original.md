```
estimate_changes(config::ChangesConfig, x [,t]) â†’ result
```

Estimate possible transitions for input timeseries `x` using the approach specified in the configuration type `config`, see [`ChangesConfig`](@ref) for possibilities. `t` is the time vector corresponding to `x`, which defaults to `eachindex(x)`.

Return the output as subtype of [`ChangesResults`](@ref). The particular form of the output depends on the `config` and is described in its docstring. Regardless of type, `result` can always be given to [`significant_transitions`](@ref) to deduce which possible transitions are statistically significant using a variety of significance tests.
