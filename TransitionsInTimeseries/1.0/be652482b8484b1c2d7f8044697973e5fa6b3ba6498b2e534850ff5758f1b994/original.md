plot_changes_significance(res, signif) â†’ (fig, axs)
```

Return `fig::Figure` and `axs::Matrix{Axis}`, on which `res::ChangesResults` and `signif::SurrogatesSignificance` have been visualised. The source code is as simple as:

```julia
fig, axs = plot_indicator_changes(res; kwargs...)
plot_significance!(axs, res, signif; kwargs...)
```
