Unit in pixels on screen. This one is a bit tricky, since it refers to a static attribute (pixels on screen don't change) but since every visual is attached to a camera, the exact scale might change. So in the end, this is just relative to some normed camera - the value on screen, depending on the camera, will not actually sit on those pixels. Only camera that guarantees the correct mapping is the `:pixel` camera type.
