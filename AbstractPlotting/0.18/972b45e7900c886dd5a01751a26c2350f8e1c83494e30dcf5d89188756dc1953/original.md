```
stem(xs, ys, [zs]; kwargs...)
```

Plots markers at the given positions extending from `offset` along stem lines.

`offset` can be a number, in which case it sets y for 2D, and z for 3D stems. It can be a Point2 for 2D plots, as well as a Point3 for 3D plots. It can also be an iterable of any of these at the same length as xs, ys, zs.

The conversion trait of stem is `PointBased`.
