```
ExaFMM{K} <: LinearMaps.LinearMap{K}
```

Is an type resembling the fmm matrix and can be multipied by a vector resembling for example the charges of the source points. This type is necassary for the garbage collector to free the allocated storage of the C++ part.

# Fields

  * `fmmoptions::FMMOptions`: Initializer either LaplaceFMMOptions, HelmholtzFMMOptions or ModifiedHelmholtzFMMOptions.
  * `nsources::Int`: Number of sources.
  * `ntargets::Int`: Number of targets.
  * `fmm::Ptr{Cvoid}`: Pointer to the fmm sruct generated by the C++ part.
  * `fmmstruct::Ptr{Cvoid}`: Pointer to an struct with all necassary substructs of the fmm. This pointer is mandatory for the comunication with the C++ part.
  * `sources::Ptr{Cvoid}`: Pointer to the C++ struct of the sources.
  * `targets::Ptr{Cvoid}`: Pointer to the C++ struct of the targets.
