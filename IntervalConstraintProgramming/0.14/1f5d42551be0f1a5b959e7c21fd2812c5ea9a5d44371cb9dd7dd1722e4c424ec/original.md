Find inner and outer approximations of the intersection of `X` with the set $S$ specified by the separator `S`.

Returns the `inner` paving (a vector of those boxes that are guaranteed to be inside $S$) and the `boundary` paving (boxes which have unknown status: they have neither been excluded, nor proved to lie inside `S`).
