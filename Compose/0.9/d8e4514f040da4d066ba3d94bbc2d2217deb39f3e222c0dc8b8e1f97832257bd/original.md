```
text(x, y, value [,halign::HAlignment [,valign::VAlignment [,rot::Rotation]]])
```

Draw the text `value` at the position (`x`,`y`) relative to the current context.

The default alignment of the text is `hleft` `vbottom`. The vertical and horizontal alignment is specified by passing `hleft`, `hcenter` or `hright` and `vtop`, `vcenter` or `vbottom` as values for `halign` and `valign` respectively.
