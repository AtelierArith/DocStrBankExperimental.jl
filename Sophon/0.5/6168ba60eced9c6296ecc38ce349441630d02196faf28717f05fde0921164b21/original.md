NonAdaptiveTraining(pde_weights=1, bcs_weights=pde_weights)
```

Fixed weights for the loss functions.

## Arguments

  * `pde_weights`: weights for the PDE loss functions. If a single number is given, it is used for all PDE loss functions.
  * `bcs_weights`: weights for the boundary conditions loss functions. If a single number is given, it is used for all boundary conditions loss functions.
