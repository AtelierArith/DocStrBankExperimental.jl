A LatticeBond is a struct which represents a single bond in a geometrical lattice or else on interaction graph defining a physical model such as a quantum Hamiltonian.

LatticeBond has the following data fields:

  * s1::Int – number of site 1
  * s2::Int – number of site 2
  * x1::Float64 – x coordinate of site 1
  * y1::Float64 – y coordinate of site 1
  * x2::Float64 – x coordinate of site 2
  * y2::Float64 – y coordinate of site 2
  * type::String – optional description of bond type
