LatticeBond(s1::Int,s2::Int)

LatticeBond(s1::Int,s2::Int,
            x1::Real,y1::Real,
            x2::Real,y2::Real,
            type::String="")

Construct a LatticeBond struct by specifying just the numbers of sites 1 and 2, or additional details including the (x,y) coordinates of the two sites and an optional type string.
