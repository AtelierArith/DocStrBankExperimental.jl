Compute the truncation of length `l` of the high growth rate infinite sequence produced by the algorithm introduced in [LJP17]. The trajectory ends at mode `v_0` (or a random one if `v_0` is `:Random`) and is built backward as explained in [LJP17]. The measures used to guide the construction are the infeasibility certificates of highest growth rate computed by [`soslyap`](@ref) with polynomials of degree `2d`. The starting polynomial is either `p_0`, or a random strictly sum-of-squares polynomial if `p_0` is `:Random` or the primal solution of [`soslyap`](@ref) certifying the best upper bound for mode `v_0`.
