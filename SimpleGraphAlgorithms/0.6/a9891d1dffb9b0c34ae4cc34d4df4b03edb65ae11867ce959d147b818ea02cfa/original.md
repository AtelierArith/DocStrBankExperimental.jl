`min_vertex_cover(G)` returns a smallest vertex cover `S` of `G`. This is a smallest possible set of vertices such that every edge of `G` has one or both end points in `S`.

`min_vertex_cover(G,k)` returns the smallest set of vertices `S` such that at least `k` edges are indicent with a vertex in `S`.
