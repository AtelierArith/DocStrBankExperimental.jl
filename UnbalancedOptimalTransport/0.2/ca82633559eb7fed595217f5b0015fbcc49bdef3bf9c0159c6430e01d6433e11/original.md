Implements algorithm 1 of [[SFVTP19](@ref)]. The `dual_potential` fields of `a` and `b` are updated to hold the optimal dual potentials. The `density`, `log_density`, and `set` fields are not modified. The parameters are

  * `D`: the [`AbstractDivergence`](@ref) used for measuring the cost of creating or destroying mass
  * `ϵ`: the regularization parameter
  * `C`: either a function from `a.set` × `b.set` to real numbers; should satisfy `C(x,y) = C(y,x)` and `C(x,x)=0` when applicable, or a precomputed cost matrix  as generated by e.g. [`cost_matrix`](@ref)
  * `tol`: the convergence tolerance
  * `max_iters`: the maximum number of iterations to perform.
  * `warn`: whether or not to warn when the maximum number of iterations is reached.

Returns a NamedTuple with `f` and `g`, the dual potentials of `a` and `b` respectively, the number of iterations performed (`iters`), and the maximum residual (`max_residual`), which is the maximum infinity norm difference between consecutive iterates of the dual potentials, at the end of the process. If `max_iters` is not reached, iteration stops when the `max_residual` falls below `tol`.

If `a` and `b` alias, then one must use the return values of `f` and `g` rather than `a.dual_potential` and `b.dual_potential`.
