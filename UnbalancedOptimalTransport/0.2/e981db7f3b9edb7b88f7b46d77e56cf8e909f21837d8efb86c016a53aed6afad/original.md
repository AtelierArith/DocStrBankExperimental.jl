This package provides an MIT license, dependency-free implementation of Algorithm 1 of "Sinkhorn Divergences for Unbalanced Optimal Transport" [SFVTP19 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12958)], which allows calculation of the optimal transport and Sinkhorn divergence between two positive measures (with possibly different total mass), where mass creation and destruction is penalized by one of several possible Ï†-divergences.
