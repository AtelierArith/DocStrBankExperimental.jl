```
lll(x::ZZMatrix, ctx::LLLContext = LLLContext(0.99, 0.51))
```

Return a matrix $L$ whose rows form an LLL-reduced basis of the $\mathbb{Z}$-lattice generated by the rows of $x$. $L$ may contain additional zero rows.

By default, the LLL is performed with reduction parameters $\delta = 0.99$ and $\eta = 0.51$. These defaults can be overridden by specifying an optional context object.

See [`lll_gram`](@ref) for a function taking the Gram matrix as input.
