csgn(a::QQBarFieldElem)
```

Return the extension of the real sign function taking the value 1 strictly in the right half plane, -1 strictly in the left half plane, and the sign of the imaginary part when on the imaginary axis. Equivalently, $\operatorname{csgn}(x) = x / \sqrt{x^2}$ except that the value is 0 at zero.
