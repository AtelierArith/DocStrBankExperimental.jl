```
next_signed_minimal(a::QQFieldElem)
```

Given a signed rational number $a$ assumed to be in canonical form, return the next element in the minimal-height sequence generated by `next_minimal` but with negative numbers interleaved. The sequence begins $0, 1, -1, 1/2, -1/2, 2, -2, 1/3, -1/3, \ldots$. Starting with zero, this generates every rational number once and only once, in order of minimal height.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> next_signed_minimal(-ZZ(21)//31)
31//21
```
