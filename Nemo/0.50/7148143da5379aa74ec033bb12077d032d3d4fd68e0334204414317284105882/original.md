AbsSimpleNumField
```

This is the basic type for absolute extensions, i.e., an extension of QQ by some irreducible monic polyomial with coefficients in either ZZ or QQ.

Creation is usually by calling [`number_field`](@ref), but see also [`cyclotomic_field`](@ref) and [`cyclotomic_real_subfield`](@ref) for some more specialized fields.
