```
lll!(x::ZZMatrix, ctx::LLLContext = LLLContext(0.99, 0.51))
```

Compute an LLL-reduced basis of the $\mathbb{Z}$-lattice generated by the rows of $x$ inplace.

By default, the LLL is performed with reduction parameters $\delta = 0.99$ and $\eta = 0.51$. These defaults can be overridden by specifying an optional context object.

See [`lll_gram!`](@ref) for a function taking the Gram matrix as input.
