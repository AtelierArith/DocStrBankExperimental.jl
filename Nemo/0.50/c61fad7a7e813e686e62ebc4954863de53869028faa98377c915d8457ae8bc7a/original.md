```
lll_with_transform(x::ZZMatrix, ctx::LLLContext = LLLContext(0.99, 0.51))
```

Return a tuple $(L, T)$ where the rows of $L$ form an LLL-reduced basis of the $\mathbb{Z}$-lattice generated by the rows of $x$ and $T$ is a transformation matrix so that $L = Tx$. $L$ may contain additional zero rows. See [`lll`](@ref) for the used default parameters which can be overridden by supplying an optional context object.

See [`lll_gram_with_transform`](@ref) for a function taking the Gram matrix as input.
