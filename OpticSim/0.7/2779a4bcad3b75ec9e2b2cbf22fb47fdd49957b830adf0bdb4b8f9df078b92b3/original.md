```
tracehits(system::AbstractOpticalSystem{T}, raygenerator::OpticalRayGenerator{T}; printprog = true, test = false)
```

Traces `system` with rays generated by `raygenerator` on a single thread. Optionally the progress can be printed to the REPL. If `test` is enabled then fresnel reflections are disabled and the power distribution will not be correct.

Returns a list of [`LensTrace`](@ref)s which hit the detector.
