`BDSymbols(n,d)`

returns  2-symbols of defect `d` and rank `n` (for Weyl types B,C,D,2D). If `d==0`  the symbols with  equal entries are  returned twice, represented as the  first entry, followed by the repetition factor 2 and an ordinal number 0 or 1, so that `BDSymbols(n, 0)` is a set of parameters for the characters of the Weyl group of type `Dâ‚™`.
