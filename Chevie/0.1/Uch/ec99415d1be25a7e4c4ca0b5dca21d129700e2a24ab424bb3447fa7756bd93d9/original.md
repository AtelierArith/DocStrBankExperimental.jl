`on_unipotents(W,aut)`

`W`  is  a  reflection  group  or  reflection  coset  representing a finite reductive group $𝐆 ^F$, and `aut` is an automorphism of $𝐆 ^F$ (for `W` a  permutation group, this can be given as a permutation of the roots). The function  returns the permutation  of the unipotent  characters of $𝐆 ^F$ induced  by `aut`. This makes sense  for Spetsial complex reflection groups and is implemented for them.

```julia-repl
