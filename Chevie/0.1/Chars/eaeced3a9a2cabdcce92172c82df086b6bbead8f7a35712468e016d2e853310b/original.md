`fakedegrees(W, q=Pol())`

returns  a list holding the fake degrees of the reflection group `W` on the vector  space `V`, evaluated at `q`. These are the graded multiplicities of the  irreducible characters of `W` in the quotient `SV/I` where `SV` is the symmetric  algebra of `V` and `I` is the ideal generated by the homogeneous invariants  of  positive  degree  in  `SV`.  The  ordering  of  the  result corresponds to the ordering of the characters in `charinfo(W)`.
