`coxeter_number(W::PermRootGroup)` or `coxnum`

Gordon  and  Griffeth  [GG2012](biblio.htm#gg12)  have defined the *Coxeter number* of an irreducible complex reflection group as the Coxeter number of its reflection character. It is also given by the formula `(nref(W)+nhyp(W))/rank(W)`;  for a well-generated group it is equal to the highest  reflection degree. For a non-irreducible group, the Coxeter number is the sum of those of its irreducible components.
