`coxeter_number(W::PermRootGroup,i)` or `coxnum`

Gordon  and  Griffeth  [GG2012](biblio.htm#gg12)  have defined the *Coxeter number*  of an irreducible  character `φ` of  a complex reflection group as the scalar by which the central element `∑_{s in reflections(W)}(1-s)` acts on  the representation of character `φ`.  The function `coxnum` returns the Coxeter number of the `i`-th irreducible character of `W`.
