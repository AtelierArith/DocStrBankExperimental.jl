`reflection_subgroup(W,r)`

returns  the  reflection  subgroup  of  the  complex  reflection  group `W` generated by `refls(W,r)`.

A  reflection subgroup `H` of  `W` is a permutation  subgroup with the same additional  information as  `W`, and  some new  one added which express the relationship with the parent `W`:

`inclusion(H)`:   the indices of the roots of `H` in the roots of `W`

`parent(H)`:  is set to `W`.

`restriction(H)`:  a list of length `length(roots(W))` with non-zero entries    in positions `inclusion(H)` bound to `eachindex(roots(H))`.

A  reflection  group  which  is  not  a  subgroup  actually  also  has this information, set to the trivial values: `inclusion(W)==restriction(W)==eachindex(roots(W))`,   and   `parent()==W`. This  allows a lot of code to be  written in the same way for parent groups or reflection subgroups.

`reflection_subgroup(R)` where `R` is itself a reflection subgroup returns a  reflection subgroup of the parent of `R`.
