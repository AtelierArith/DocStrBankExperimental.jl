`intermediate_group(W, indices)`

returns a `rootdatum` which represents a semisimple algebraic group between the   adjoint  group,  obtained  by  a  call  like  `rootdatum(:pgl,4)`  or `coxgroup(:A,3)`, and the simply connected semi-simple group, obtained by a call  like  `rootdatum(:sl,4)`  or  `coxgroup(:A,3;sc=true)`. This group is specified  by a subset of the *minuscule weights*, the weights whose scalar product  with each  coroot is  in `-1,0,1`  (a weight  is an element of the *weight  lattice*  `P`,  the  lattice  dual  to  the  coroot  lattice). The non-trivial  characters of the  (algebraic) center of  a semi-simple simply connected  algebraic group are in bijection with the minuscule weights, and also  in bijection  with `P/Q`  where `Q`  is the  root lattice.  If `W` is irreducible,  the minuscule  weights are  part of  the basis  of the weight lattice  given by the *fundamental weights*, which is the dual basis of the simple  coroots. They can therefore be specified  by an index in the Dynkin diagram.  The  `indices`  of  minuscule  weights  in the dynkin diagram are indices  where the coefficient of  the highest root on  the simple roots is `1`. The constructed intermediate group has lattice `X(𝐓)` generated by the root  lattice and the given minuscule weights. If `W` is not irreducible, a minuscule  weight is a sum of minuscule weights in different components; an element of `indices` is thus itself a list, interpreted as representing the sum of the corresponding weights.
