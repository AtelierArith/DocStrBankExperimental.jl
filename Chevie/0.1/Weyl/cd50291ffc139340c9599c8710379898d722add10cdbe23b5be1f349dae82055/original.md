`rootdatum(R::AbstractMatrix,CR::AbstractMatrix)`

constructs  the root datum given by the  simple roots which are the rows of `R`  and  the  simple  coroots  which  are  the  rows  of `CR`. This is the reflection  group  on  the  rowspace  of  `R`  generated by the reflections `reflectionMatrix(R[i,:],CR[i,:])`.

In  another interpretation this constructs the  root datum of the algebraic group  such that the rows of `R` are  the simple roots on a basis of `X(T)` and  the rows of `CR` are the simple  coroots on a basis of `Y(T)`. In this interpretation the following methods all define `gl₃`.

```julia-repl
julia> rootdatum(:gl,3)==rootdatum("gl",3)
true

julia> rootdatum([1 -1 0;0 1 -1],[1 -1 0;0 1 -1])
A₂Φ₁
```
