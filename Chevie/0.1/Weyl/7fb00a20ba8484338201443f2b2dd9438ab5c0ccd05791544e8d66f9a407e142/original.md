`relative_group(W::FiniteCoxeterGroup,J)`

`J`  should be a if *distinguished* subset of `S==eachindex(gens(W))`, that is if for `s∈ S-J` we set $v(s,J)=w₀^{J∪ s}w₀ᴶ$ then `J` is stable by all `v(s,J)`.  Then $N_W(W_J)=W_J⋊ N₁$  where `N₁` is  the group generated by the  `v(s,J)`,  which  form  a  Coxeter  system for `N₁`. Equivalently `N₁` consists   of  the   `J`-reduced  elements   of  `N_W(W_J)`.  The  quotient `R=N_W(W_J)/W_J` has a natural reflection representation on $X(ZL_J/ZG)$, using  that by [Lusztig1976](biblio.htm#Lus76), the  images of the roots of `W`  in  $X(ZL_J)$  form  a  root  system.  The function returns `R` as a reflection  group on $X(ZL_J/ZG)$, with  some extra attributes reflecting its origin

  * `R.relative_indices=setdiff(S,J)` in a certain order
  * `R.toparent=` the list of `v(s,J)` corresponding to `.relative_indices`;  defines an isomorphism `R→ N₁`.
  * `R.fromparent`  is  a  function  mapping elements of `N₁` to `R`. The  inverse mapping to `.toparent`.
