`reflection_subgroup(W::FiniteCoxeterGroup,I)`

For `I⊆1:nref(W)`, the subgroup `H` of `W` generated by `refls(W,I)`.

A   theorem  found  independently  by  [Deodhar1989](biblio.htm#Deo89)  and [Dyer1990](biblio.htm#Dye90)  is that  a subgroup  `H` of  a Coxeter system `(W,S)`  generated by reflections  has a canonical  Coxeter generating set, formed  of the `t  ∈ Ref(H)` such  `length(W,tt')>length(W,t)` for any `t'∈ Ref(H)`  different  from  `t`.  This  is  used  by `reflection_subgroup` to determine the Coxeter system of `H`.

```julia-repl
julia> W=coxgroup(:G,2)
G₂

julia> diagram(W)
O⇛ O G₂
1  2

julia> H=reflection_subgroup(W,[2,6])
G₂₍₂₆₎=Ã₁×A₁

julia> diagram(H)
O Ã₁
1
O A₁
2
```

The  notation `G₂₍₂₆₎`  means that  `roots(W,[2,6])` is  a system of simple roots for `H`.

If  `H` is a  standard parabolic subgroup  of a Coxeter  group `W` then the length  function on  `H` (with  respect to  its set  of generators)  is the restriction  of the length function on `W`. This need not no longer be true for  arbitrary reflection subgroups of  `W`. 

```julia-repl
julia> elH=word.(Ref(H),elements(H))
4-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 []
 [1]
 [2]
 [1, 2]

julia> elW=word.(Ref(W),elements(H))
4-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 []
 [2]
 [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
 [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]

julia> map(w->H(w...),elH)==map(w->W(w...),elW)
true
```

We  implement finite  reflection groups  as permutation  groups on a set of roots.  Consequently,  a  reflection  subgroup  `H⊆  W`  is  a  permutation subgroup, thus its elements are represented as permutations of the roots of the parent group.
