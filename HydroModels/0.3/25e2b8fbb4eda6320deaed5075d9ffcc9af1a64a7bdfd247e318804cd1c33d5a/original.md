```
HydroBucket{N,S} <: AbstractBucket
```

A flexible struct for organizing and executing model components.

# Fields

  * `fluxes::Vector{<:AbstractHydroFlux}`: List of process functions to be applied.
  * `dfluxes::Vector{<:AbstractStateFlux}`: List of state derivative functions for ODE support.
  * `flux_funcs::Vector{<:Function}`: Precompiled functions for evaluating all fluxes efficiently.
  * `ode_funcs::Union{Nothing,Vector}`: Functions for ODE calculations, or `nothing` if not needed.
  * `infos::NamedTuple`: Metadata including input, output, state, parameter, and neural network names.

# Constructor

```julia
HydroBucket(; name=nothing, fluxes, dfluxes=StateFlux[])
```

  * `name::Union{Symbol,Nothing}`: Optional identifier for the bucket. Defaults to an autogenerated name.
  * `fluxes::Vector{<:AbstractHydroFlux}`: Required. Main computational elements.
  * `dfluxes::Vector{<:AbstractStateFlux}`: Optional. State derivatives for ODE support.

# Usage Example

```julia
bucket = HydroBucket(
    name = :example_bucket,
    fluxes = [MyFlux1(), MyFlux2()],
    dfluxes = [MyStateFlux()]
)
```

# Notes

  * Type parameters `N` and `S` are set internally and generally not user-specified.
  * Designed for modularity and integration in larger modeling systems.
  * Efficient function generation and metadata tracking are handled automatically.
