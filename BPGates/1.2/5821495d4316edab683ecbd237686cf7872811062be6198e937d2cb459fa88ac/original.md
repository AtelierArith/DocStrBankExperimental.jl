Bell preserving gate performing one of 6 possible "Clifford phaseless permutations" on a single Bell pair.

Equivalent to applying certain single-qubit Clifford gates to both Alice and Bob.

The first argument, `pidx`, specifies the permutation (between 1 and 6). The second argument, `sidx` indicates which Bell pair is acted on.
