Bell preserving gate performing one of 20 possible "Clifford phaseless two-pair permutations" on a two Bell pairs.

Equivalent to applying the same two-qubit Clifford gate to both Alice's and Bob's half-pairs.

The first argument, `pidx`, specifies the permutation (between 1 and 20). The second argument, `sidx` indicates which Bell pairs are acted on.
