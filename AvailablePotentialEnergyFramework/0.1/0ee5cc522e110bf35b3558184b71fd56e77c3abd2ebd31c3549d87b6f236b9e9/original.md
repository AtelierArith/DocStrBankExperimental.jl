Computes the mean precipitation as a function of the binned precipitable water following Yang, D., 2018: Boundary Layer Height and Buoyancy Determine the Horizontal Scale of Convective Self-Aggregation. J. Atmos. Sci., 75, 469â€“478, https://doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-17-0150.1. It will be happy if bins is quite large (example from 0 to 300 mm).
