```
ArbitraryKnotSet{k,ml,mr}(t)
```

An arbitrary knot set of order `k` and left and right multiplicities of `ml` and `mr`, respectively. The knot set is specified by the non-decreasing vector `t`; the same knot may appear multiple times, which influences the continuity of the B-splines at that location.
