```
cylinders_2d(; seed=nothing, frequency=1.0)
```

Construct a sampler that outputs values that form a pattern representing concentric cylinders when it is sampled from.

# Arguments

  * `seed`: An unsigned integer used to seed the random number generator for this sampler, or `nothing` for non-deterministic results.
  * `frequency`: The frequency of the signal, which controls how small or large the cylinders are.
