```
make_bins(vec)
```

Calculate the bin edges and bin widths for a vector given the distances between each entry

ADDITIONAL NOTES: 

```
- This function has been adapted from the SpectRes python package, https://github.com/ACCarnall/SpectRes,
  by Adam Carnall. Please refer to Carnall (2017): https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170505165C/abstract
  for an explanation of the theory behind the spectral resampling procedure.  This function is a translation
  of `make_bins` from SpectRes and performs the same functions.
