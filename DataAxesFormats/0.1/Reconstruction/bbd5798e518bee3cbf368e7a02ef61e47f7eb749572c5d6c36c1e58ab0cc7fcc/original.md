Reconstruct implicit axes. Due to `AnnData` two-axes limitations, other axes are often represented by storing their expanded data (e.g., a type for each cell, and a color for each cell, where the color is actually per type). When converting such data to `Daf`, it is useful to reconstruct such axes (e.g., create a type axis, assign a color for each type, and delete the per-cell color property).
