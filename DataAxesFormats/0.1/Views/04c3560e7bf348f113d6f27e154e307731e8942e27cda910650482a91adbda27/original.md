Create a different view of `Daf` data using queries. This is a very flexible mechanism which can be used for a variety of use cases. A simple way of using this is to view a subset of the data as a `Daf` data set. A variant of this also renames the data properties to adapt them to the requirements of some computation. This makes it simpler to create such tools (using fixed, generic property names) and apply them to arbitrary data (with arbitrary specific property names).
