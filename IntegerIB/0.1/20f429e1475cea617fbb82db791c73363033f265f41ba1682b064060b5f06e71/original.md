Interface for IB clustering computation. Input data 'x' must be 1D. Î² controls the amount of clustering : the smaller the beta, the greater the clustering (and information loss). Can be initalized directly with the data via IB(x), or if you already have the histograms/probability of co-occurences of 'x' and 'y' via IB(pxy). To use the deterministic IB algorithm, set algorithm to "DIB" like IB(x, "DIB").
