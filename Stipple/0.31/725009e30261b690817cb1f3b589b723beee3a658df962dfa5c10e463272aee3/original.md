```
type ReactiveModel
```

The abstract type that is inherited by Stipple models. Stipple models are used for automatic 2-way data sync and data exchange between the Julia backend and the JavaScript/Vue.js frontend.

### Example

```julia
Base.@kwdef mutable struct HelloPie <: ReactiveModel
  plot_options::R{PlotOptions} = PlotOptions(chart_type=:pie, chart_width=380, chart_animations_enabled=true,
                                            stroke_show = false, labels=["Slice A", "Slice B"])
  piechart::R{Vector{Int}} = [44, 55]
  values::R{String} = join(piechart, ",")
end
```
