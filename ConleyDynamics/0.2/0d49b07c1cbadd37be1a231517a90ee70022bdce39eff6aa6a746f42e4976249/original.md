filter_induced_mvf(lc::LefschetzComplex, phi)
```

Compute the multivector field induced by a filter.

This function returns the smallest multivector field which has the property that every shallow pair is contained in a multivector. For injective filters this is a Forman vector field, but in the noninjective case it can be a general multivector field.
