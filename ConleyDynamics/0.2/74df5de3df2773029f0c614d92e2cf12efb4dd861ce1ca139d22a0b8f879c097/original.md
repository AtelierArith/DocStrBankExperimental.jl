```
sc, vfG, vfC = example_torsion_chaos(n::Int, p::Int)
```

Create a triangulation of a space with 1-dimensional torsion, as well as two Forman vectr fields on this complex.

The function returns a simplicial complex `sc` which has the following integer homology groups:

  * In dimension 0 it is the group of integers.
  * In dimension 1 it is the integers modulo `n`.
  * In dimension 2 it is the trivial group.

In other words, the simplicial complex has nontrivial torsion in dimension 1. It is a triangulation of an `n`-gon, in which all boundary edges are oriented counterclockwise, and all of these edges are identified. The parameter `p` specifies the characteristic of the underlying field.

In addition, two Forman vector fields `vfG` and `vfC` are returned. The first one is a gradient vector field whose connection matrix has a large connection matrix entry. In fact, if `p` is any prime larger than `n` then there will be an entry `n` in the matrix. The scond Forman vector field contains a chaotic Morse set. This Morse set will have trivial Morse index for most `p`. On the other hand, for prime `p = n` the set has the Morse index of an unstable  periodic orbit.
