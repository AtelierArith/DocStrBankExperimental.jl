# BarycentricInterpolation

This package implements the Barycentric formula for polynomial interpolation on equispaced points and Chebyshev points of the first and second kind. The formulae used are taken from the paper of Berrut and Trefethen, SIAM Review,

2004. 

Additional Barycentric weights for Legendre points are taken from the paper of Wang, Huybrechs, and Vandewalle, Mathematics of Computation, 83 (290) 2893-2914, 2014.

Other packages that may be of interest are FastGaussQuadrature and ApproxFun.
