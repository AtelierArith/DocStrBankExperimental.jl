DistributedLoads{T}
```

Type which contains pre-integrated distributed forces and moments applied to a beam element.

# Fields

  * f1: Integrated non-follower distributed force corresponding to the start of the beam element.
  * f2: Integrated non-follower distributed force corresponding to the end of the beam element.
  * m1: Integrated non-follower distributed moment corresponding to the start of the beam element.
  * m2: Integrated non-follower distributed moment corresponding to the end of the beam element.
  * f1_follower: Integrated follower distributed force corresponding to the start of the beam element.
  * f2_follower: Integrated follower distributed force corresponding to the end of the beam element.
  * m1_follower: Integrated follower distributed moment corresponding to the start of the beam element.
  * m2_follower: Integrated follower distributed moment corresponding to the end of the beam element.
