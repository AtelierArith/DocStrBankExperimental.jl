!!! warning "Deprecation Warning"
    As of Gen 0.4.6, this macro is no longer necessary in order to use the static modeling language. It will be removed in a future release.


Previously, this permitted the use of generative functions written in the static modeling language by loading their associated function definitions into the specified module.
