```
true_double_cycle([rng], [T], dims...; 
    cycle_weight=0.1, second_cycle_weight=0.1,
    return_sparse=false)
```

Creates a true double cycle reservoir, ispired by [^fu2023], with cycles built on the definition by [^rodan2010].

# Arguments

  * `rng`: Random number generator. Default is `Utils.default_rng()` from WeightInitializers.
  * `T`: Type of the elements in the reservoir matrix. Default is `Float32`.
  * `dims`: Dimensions of the reservoir matrix.

# Keyword arguments

  * `cycle_weight`: Weight of the upper cycle connections in the reservoir matrix. Default is 0.1.
  * `second_cycle_weight`: Weight of the lower cycle connections in the reservoir matrix. Default is 0.1.
  * `return_sparse`: flag for returning a `sparse` matrix. Default is `false`.
  * `cycle_kwargs`, and `second_cycle_kwargs`: named tuples that control the kwargs for the weights generation. The kwargs are as follows:

      * `sampling_type`: Sampling that decides the distribution of `weight` negative numbers. If set to `:no_sample` the sign is unchanged. If set to `:bernoulli_sample!` then each `weight` can be positive with a probability set by `positive_prob`. If set to `:irrational_sample!` the `weight` is negative if the decimal number of the irrational number chosen is odd. If set to `:regular_sample!`, each weight will be assigned a negative sign after the chosen `strides`. `strides` can be a single number or an array. Default is `:no_sample`.
      * `positive_prob`: probability of the `weight` being positive when `sampling_type` is set to `:bernoulli_sample!`. Default is 0.5.
      * `irrational`: Irrational number whose decimals decide the sign of `weight`. Default is `pi`.
      * `start`: Which place after the decimal point the counting starts for the `irrational` sign counting. Default is 1.
      * `strides`: number of strides for assigning negative value to a weight. It can be an integer or an array. Default is 2.
