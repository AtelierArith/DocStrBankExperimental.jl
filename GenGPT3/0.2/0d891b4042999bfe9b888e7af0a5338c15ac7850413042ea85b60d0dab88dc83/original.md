MultiGPT3Trace
```

A trace generated by a [`MultiGPT3GenerativeFunction`](@ref). Effectively represents a vector of [`GPT3Trace`](@ref) subtraces.

`Base.getindex(trace::MultiGPT3Trace, addr)` supports the following values for `addr`:

  * `:prompts`: The prompts provided to the language model.
  * `:outputs`: The outputs generated for each prompt.
  * `:tokens`: Vector of vectors of output tokens, including the stop sequence.
  * `:token_logprobs`: Vector of vectors of token log probabilities.
  * `:output_scores`: The log probabilities of each output.
  * `:score`: The total log probability of generating all outputs.

In addition, `addr` can take the form `i => subaddr`, where `i` is an integer, in order to access the `:prompt`, `:output`, `:tokens`, `:token_logprobs`, or `:score` for the `i`-th subtrace.
