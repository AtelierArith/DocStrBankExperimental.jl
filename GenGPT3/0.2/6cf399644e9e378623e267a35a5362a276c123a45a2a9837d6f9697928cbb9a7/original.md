GPT3MixtureTrace
```

A trace generated by a mixture distribution over language model prompts.

`Base.getindex(trace::GPT3MixtureTrace, addr)` supports the following values for `addr`:

  * `:prompt`: The prompt provided as an argument to the language model.
  * `:prior_probs`: The prior probability of each prompt.
  * `:post_probs`: The posterior probability of each prompt.
  * `:joint_probs`: The joint probability of each prompt with the output.
  * `:tokens`: Vector of output tokens, including the stop sequence.
  * `:output`: The output completion generated by the language model.
  * `:output_scores`: Log probabilities of the output under each prompt.
  * `:score`: Total log probability of the output, marginalized over prompts.
