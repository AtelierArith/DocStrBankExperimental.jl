GPT3Trace
```

A trace generated by a [`GPT3GenerativeFunction`](@ref). This trace has  exactly one choice address, `output`, denoting the completion output generated by the language model. The return value is also the completion output.

`Base.getindex(trace::GPT3Trace, addr)` supports the following values for `addr`:

  * `:prompt`: The prompt provided as an argument to the language model.
  * `:output`: The output completion generated by the language model.
  * `:tokens`: Vector of output tokens, including the stop sequence.
  * `:token_logprobs`: The log probability of each token.
  * `:score`: The total log probability of generating the output.
