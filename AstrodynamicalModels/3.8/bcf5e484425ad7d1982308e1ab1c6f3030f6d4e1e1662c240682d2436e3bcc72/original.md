```julia
NBSystem(N; stm, name, defaults, kwargs...)

```

A `ModelingToolkit.ODESystem` for the Newtonian N-body Problem.

The order of the states follows: `[x‚ÇÅ, y‚ÇÅ, z‚ÇÅ, ..., x‚Çô, y‚Çô, z‚Çô, xÃá‚ÇÅ, yÃá‚ÇÅ, zÃá‚ÇÅ, ..., xÃá‚Çô, yÃá‚Çô, zÃá‚Çô]`.

The order of the parameters follows: `[G, m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ, ..., m‚Çô]`.

!!! warning
    Be careful about specifying `stm=true` for systems with `N ‚â• 3`! If state transition matrix dynamics are enabled, you can calculate the total number of system states with `N*6 + (N*6)^2`. Note that this increases exponentially as `N` grows! For `N == 6`, unless you're using parallelization, your computer may run for several hours.


# Extended Help

The N-body problem is a model which describes how `N` bodies will move with respect to a common origin. This problem typically involves many bodies which act due to one force: electromagentism, gravity, etc. This model applies most closely to many celestial bodies moving due to gravity. That's about right for a model in a package called `AstrodynamicalModels`!

### Usage

```julia
# One model for ALL the planets in our solar system üòé
model = NBSystem(9)
```
