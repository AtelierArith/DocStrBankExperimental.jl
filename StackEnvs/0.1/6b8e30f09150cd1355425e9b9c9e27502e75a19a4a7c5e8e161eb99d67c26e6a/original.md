```
activate_env(env::StackEnv)
```

Activate the shared environment `env.name`.

You might want to do this to add or remove packages from the environment. But it is not necessary to activate it to use it.

See [`StackEnv`](@ref), [`create_env`](@ref), [`ensure_in_stack`](@ref), [`env_exists`](@ref).
