```
module StackEnvs
```

Failites for managing an environment that is not active, but in the stack.

The module defines [`StackEnv`](@ref) which represents an environment meant to used in the enironment stack rather than as an active environment.

There are some functions missing. For example, for adding and removing packages from the `StackEnv`. This can be done manually, but is would be a bit fiddle. These functions might be added later.
