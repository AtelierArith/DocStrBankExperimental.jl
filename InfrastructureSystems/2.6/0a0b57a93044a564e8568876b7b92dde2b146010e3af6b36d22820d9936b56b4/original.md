An incremental (or 'marginal') curve, relating the production quantity to the derivative of cost: `y = f'(x)`. Can be used, for instance, in the representation of a [`CostCurve`](@ref) where `x` is MW and `y` is currency/MWh, or in the representation of a [`FuelCurve`](@ref) where `x` is MW and `y` is fuel/MWh.
