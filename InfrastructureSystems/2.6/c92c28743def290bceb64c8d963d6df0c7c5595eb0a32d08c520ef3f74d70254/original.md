Structure to represent the underlying data of quadratic functions. Principally used for the representation of cost functions `f(x) = quadratic_term*x^2 + proportional_term*x + constant_term`.

# Arguments

  * `quadratic_term::Float64`: the quadratic term in the represented function
  * `proportional_term::Float64`: the proportional term in the represented function
  * `constant_term::Float64`: the constant term in the represented function
