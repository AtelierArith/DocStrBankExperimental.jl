An average rate curve, relating the production quantity to the average cost rate from the origin: `y = f(x)/x`. Can be used, for instance, in the representation of a [`CostCurve`](@ref) where `x` is MW and `y` is currency/MWh, or in the representation of a [`FuelCurve`](@ref) where `x` is MW and `y` is fuel/MWh. Typically calculated by dividing absolute values of cost rate or fuel input rate by absolute values of electric power.
