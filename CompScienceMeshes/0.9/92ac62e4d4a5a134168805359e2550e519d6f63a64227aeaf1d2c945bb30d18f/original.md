```
pairs = cellpairs(mesh, edges, dropjunctionpair=false)
```

Given a mesh and set of oriented edges from that mesh (as generated by `skeleton`),     `cellpairs` will generate a 2 x K matrix, where K is the number of pairs     and each column contains a pair of indices in the cell array of `mesh` that have     one of the supplied edges in common.

Returns an array of pairs of indices, each pair corresponding to a pair of adjacent faces.

(If the mesh is oriented, the first row of `facepairs` will contain indices to the cell     for which the corresponding edge has a positive relative orientation.

If a edge lies on the boundary of the mesh, and only has one neighboring cell, the     second row of `facepairs` will contain `-k` with `k` the local index of the corresponding     edge in its neighboring triangle.

If an edge has more than two neighboring cells (i.e. the edge is on a junction),     all possible pairs of cells that have the junction edge in common are supplied. if     `dropjunctionpair == false` then one of the possible pairs of cells is not recorded.     This is done to avoid the creation of linearly dependent basis functions in the     construction of boundary element methods for Maxwell's equations.)
