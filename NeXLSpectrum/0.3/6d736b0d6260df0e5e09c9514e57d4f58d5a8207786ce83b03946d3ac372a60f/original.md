Represents the processed spectral data necessary to efficiently filter-fit one or more unknown spectra. A `FilterFitPacket{S<:Detector, T<:AbstractFloat}` contains the data necessary to filter the unknown and to  apply pre-filtered references.  The type `T <: AbstractFloat` allows you to specify the bit-depth used to perform subsequent calculations using this `FilterFitPacket`.  `Float32` uses less memory and is a little faster than `Float64`.  If there are duplicate `FilteredReference` for an elemental ROI, the preference  is for the first one.  This allows you to fill in unavailable "FilteredReference" elemental ROIs with more  general ones.
