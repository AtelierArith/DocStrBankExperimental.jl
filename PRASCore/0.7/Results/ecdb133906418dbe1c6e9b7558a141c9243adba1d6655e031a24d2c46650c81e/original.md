LOLE
```

`LOLE` reports loss of load expectation over a particular time period and regional extent. When the reporting period is a single simulation timestep, the metric is equivalent to loss of load probability (LOLP).

Contains both the estimated value itself as well as the standard error of that estimate, which can be extracted with `val` and `stderror`, respectively.
