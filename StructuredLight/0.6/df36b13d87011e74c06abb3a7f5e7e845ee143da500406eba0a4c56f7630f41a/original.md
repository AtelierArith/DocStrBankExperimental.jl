```
double_slit(x, y, a, d)
```

Determine if points (x, y) are within a double slit aperture centered at the origin. Each slit has width `a` and they are separated by distance `d`.

# Arguments

  * `x`: x-coordinates of the points.
  * `y`: y-coordinates of the points.
  * `a`: Width of each slit.
  * `d`: Distance between the centers of the slits.

# Returns

  * A boolean array indicating whether each point is within the double slit aperture.
