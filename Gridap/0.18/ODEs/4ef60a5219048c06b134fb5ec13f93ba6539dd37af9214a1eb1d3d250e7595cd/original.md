abstract type TransientFEOperator <: GridapType end
```

Transient version of `FEOperator` corresponding to a residual of the form

```
residual(t, u, v) = 0,
```

where `residual` is linear in `v`. Time derivatives of `u` can be included by using the `âˆ‚t` operator.

# Important

For now, the residual and jacobians cannot be directly computed on a `TransientFEOperator`. They have to be evaluated on the corresponding algebraic operator, which is an `ODEOperator`. As such, `TransientFEOperator` is not exactly a subtype of `FEOperator`, but rather at the intersection of `FEOperator` and `ODEOperator`. This is because the `ODEOperator` works with vectors and it is optimised to take advantage of constant forms.
