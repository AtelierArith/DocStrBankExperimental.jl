```
blend(from::Point, startradius, to::Point, endradius)
```

Create an empty radial blend.

Radial blends are defined by two circles that define the start and stop locations. The first point is the center of the start circle, the first radius is the radius of the first circle.

A new blend is empty. To add colors, use `addstop()`.
