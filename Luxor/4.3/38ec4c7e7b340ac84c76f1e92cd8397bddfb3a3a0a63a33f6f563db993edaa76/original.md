```
hexcube_linedraw(hexa::Hexagon, hexb::Hexagon)
```

Find and return the hexagons that lie (mostly) on a straight line between `hexa` and `hexb`. If you filled/stroked them appropriately, you'd get a jagged line.

For more information about making hexagons and hexagonal grids, see [Luxor.Hexagon](@ref).
