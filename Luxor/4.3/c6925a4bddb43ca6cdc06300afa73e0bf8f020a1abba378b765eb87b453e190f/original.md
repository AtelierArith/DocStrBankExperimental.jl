```
getnearestpointonline(pt1::Point, pt2::Point, startpt::Point)
```

Given a line passing through `pt1` and `pt2`, return the point where a line starting at `startpt` would meet the line at right angles. The point may or may not lie on the line between `pt1` and `pt2` - use `ispointonline()` to see if it does.

See aalso `perpendicular()`.
