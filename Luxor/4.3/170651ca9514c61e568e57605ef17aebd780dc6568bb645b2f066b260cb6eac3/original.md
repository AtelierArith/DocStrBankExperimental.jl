```
placeimage(pngimg, pos=O; centered=false)
placeimage(pngimg, xpos, ypos; centered=false)
```

Place the PNG image on the drawing at `pos`, or (`xpos`/`ypos`). The image `img` has been previously read using `readpng()`.

Use keyword `centered=true` to place the center of the image at the position.
