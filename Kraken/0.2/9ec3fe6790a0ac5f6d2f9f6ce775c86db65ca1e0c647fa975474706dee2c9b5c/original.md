UnderwaterEnvFORTRAN(ssp, layers, sspHS)
```

Constructor for `UnderwaterEnvFORTRAN`. The input matrices are the same as the matrices used in the FORTRAN version of KRAKEN. These are the sound speed profile `ssp`, the layer information `layers`, and the sound speed profile at the surface and bottom half-space `sspHS`.
