```
AcousticProblemProperties(env::UnderwaterEnv, freq; factor=1, n_per_wavelength=20)
```

Properties of the acoustic problem based on the underwater environment `env` and frequency `freq`. `factor` is a factor for the mesh spacing and `n_per_wavelength` is the number of mesh points per wavelength.
