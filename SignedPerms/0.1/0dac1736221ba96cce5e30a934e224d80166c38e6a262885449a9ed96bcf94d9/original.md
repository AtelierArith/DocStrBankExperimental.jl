`struct SPerm`

An  `SPerm` represents a signed permutation of `1:n`, that is a permutation of  the  set  `-n,…,-1,1,…,n`  which  preserves  the  pairs `(-i,i)`. It is implemented  by a `struct SPerm` which has  one field `d`, a vector holding the images of `1:n`. It is printed as its cycle decomposition.
