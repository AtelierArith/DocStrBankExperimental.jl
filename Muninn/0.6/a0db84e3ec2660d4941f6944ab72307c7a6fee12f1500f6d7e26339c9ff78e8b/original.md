```
compute_MB(mb_model::TImodel1, climate_2D_period::Climate2Dstep)
```

Compute the mass balance (MB) for a given mass balance model and climate period.

# Arguments

  * `mb_model::TImodel1`: The mass balance model containing parameters such as accumulation factor (`acc_factor`) and degree-day factor (`DDF`).
  * `climate_2D_period::Climate2Dstep`: The climate data for a specific period, including snow accumulation (`snow`) and positive degree days (`PDD`).

# Returns

  * A numerical array representing the computed mass balance, calculated as the difference between the product of the accumulation factor and snow, and the product of the degree-day factor and positive degree days.
