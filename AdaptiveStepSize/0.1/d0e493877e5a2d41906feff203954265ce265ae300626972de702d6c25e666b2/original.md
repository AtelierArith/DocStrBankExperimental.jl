Main module for `AdaptiveStepSize.jl`, a Julia package used to obtain the minimum amount of points needed for the interpolation of a function in the given interval within the desired tolerance.

Only linear interpolation methods are implemented for now. Any contribution is wecolmed to further implement other methods.
