```

Compute for a descriptor system `sys = (A-λE,B,C,D)` the `H2` norm of its transfer function  matrix `G(λ)`. The `H2` norm is infinite, if `G(λ)` has unstable poles, or, for a continuous-time, the system has nonzero gain at infinity. If the pencil `A-λE` has uncontrollable and/or unobservable unstable eigenvalues on the boundary of the stability domain, then a reduced order realization is determined first (see below) to eliminate these eigenvalues. 

To check the stability, the eigenvalues of the *pole pencil* `A-λE` must have real parts less  than `-β` for a continuous-time system or  have moduli less than `1-β` for a discrete-time system, where `β` is the stability domain boundary offset. The offset  `β` to be used can be specified via the keyword parameter `offset = β`.  The default value used for `β` is `sqrt(ϵ)`, where `ϵ` is the working machine precision. 

For a continuous-time system `sys` with `E` singular, a reduced order realization is determined first, without  uncontrollable and unobservable finite and infinite eigenvalues of the pencil `A-λE`.  For a discrete-time system or for a system with invertible `E`, a reduced order realization is determined first, without  uncontrollable and unobservable finite eigenvalues of the pencil `A-λE`. The rank determinations in the performed reductions are based on rank revealing QR-decompositions with column pivoting  if `fast = true` or the more reliable SVD-decompositions if `fast = false`.   

The keyword arguments `atol1`, `atol2`, and `rtol`, specify, respectively,  the absolute tolerance for the nonzero elements of `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`,   the absolute tolerance for the nonzero elements of `E`,   and the relative tolerance for the nonzero elements of `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` and `E`.   The keyword argument `atolinf` is the absolute tolerance for the gain of `G(λ)` at `λ = ∞`.  The used default value is `atolinf = 0`.  The default relative tolerance is `n*ϵ`, where `ϵ` is the working machine epsilon  and `n` is the order of the system `sys`. The keyword argument `atol` can be used  to simultaneously set `atol1 = atol` and `atol2 = atol`.
