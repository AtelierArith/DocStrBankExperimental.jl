Compute for a descriptor system `sys = (A-λE,B,C,D)` the `L2` norm of its transfer function  matrix `G(λ)`. The `L2` norm is infinite if `G(λ)` has poles on the stability domain boundary, i.e.,  on the extended imaginary axis, in the continuous-time case,  or on the unit circle, in the discrete-time case.  The `L2` norm is also infinite for a continuous-time system having a gain at infinity greater than `atolinf`.  If the pencil `A-λE` has uncontrollable and/or unobservable eigenvalues on the boundary of the stability domain, then a reduced order realization is determined first (see below) to eliminate these eigenvalues. 

To check the lack of poles on the stability domain boundary, the eigenvalues of the pencil `A-λE`  must not have real parts in the interval `[-β,β]` for a continuous-time system or  must not have moduli in the interval `[1-β,1+β]` for a discrete-time system, where `β` is the stability domain boundary offset.   The offset  `β` to be used can be specified via the keyword parameter `offset = β`.  The default value used for `β` is `sqrt(ϵ)`, where `ϵ` is the working machine precision. 

If `h2norm = true`, the `H2` norm is computed.  The `H2` norm is infinite if the *pole pencil* `A-λE` has unstable zeros (i.e., unstable poles), or for a continuous-time system having a gain at infinity greater than `atolinf`.   To check the stability, the eigenvalues of the pencil `A-λE` must have real parts less than `-β` for a continuous-time system or  have moduli less than `1-β` for a discrete-time system. 

For a continuous-time system `sys` with `E` singular, a reduced order realization is determined first, without  uncontrollable and unobservable finite and infinite eigenvalues of the pencil `A-λE`.  For a discrete-time system or for a system with invertible `E`, a reduced order realization is determined first, without  uncontrollable and unobservable finite eigenvalues of the pencil `A-λE`. The rank determinations in the performed reductions are based on rank revealing QR-decompositions with column pivoting  if `fast = true` or the more reliable SVD-decompositions if `fast = false`.   

The keyword arguments `atol1`, `atol2`, and `rtol`, specify, respectively,  the absolute tolerance for the nonzero elements of `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`,   the absolute tolerance for the nonzero elements of `E`,   and the relative tolerance for the nonzero elements of `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` and `E`.   The keyword argument `atol3` specifies the absolute tolerance for the nonzero elements of `B` and is only used if `h2norm = false` for controllability tests of unstable eigenvalues.  The keyword argument `atolinf` is the absolute tolerance for the gain of `G(λ)` at  `λ = ∞`.  The used default value is `atolinf = 0`.  The default relative tolerance is `n*ϵ`, where `ϵ` is the working machine epsilon  and `n` is the order of the system `sys`. The keyword argument `atol` can be used  to simultaneously set `atol1 = atol`, `atol2 = atol` and `atol3 = atol`.
