`DiscreteFunction` is a function from `{1,2,...,n}` to itself. It can be created by `DiscreteFunction(list)` where `list` is a one-dimensional array of positive integers. Alternatively, it can be created using positive integer arguments.

The following are equivalent:

```
DiscreteFunction([1,4,2,3])
DiscreteFunction(1,4,2,3)
```
