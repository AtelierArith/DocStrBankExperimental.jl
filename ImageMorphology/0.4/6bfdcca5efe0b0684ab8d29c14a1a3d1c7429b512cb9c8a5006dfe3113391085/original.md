A function g is an lower leveling of a function f if and only if  for any couple of neighbouring pixels (p, q) g(p)>g(q)->g(p)>=f This algorithm modify marker to become a high_leveling of ref

The `dims` keyword is used to specify the dimension to process by constructing the box shape structuring element [`strel_box(marker; dims)`](@ref strel_box). For generic structuring element, the half-size is expected to be either `0` or `1` along each dimension.
