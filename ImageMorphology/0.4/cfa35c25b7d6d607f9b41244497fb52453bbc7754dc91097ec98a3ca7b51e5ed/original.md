struct GuoAlgo <: ThinAlgo end
```

The Guo algorithm evaluates three conditions in order to determine which pixels of the image should be removed.

The three conditions are explained in the page 361 of **Guo, Z., & Hall, R. W. (1989). Parallel thinning with two-subiteration algorithms. Communications of the ACM, 32(3), 359-373.**
