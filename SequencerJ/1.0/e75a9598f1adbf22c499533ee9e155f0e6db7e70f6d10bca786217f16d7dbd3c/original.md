Sample columns of A and run the Sequencer algorithm against this subspace to identify the  scale at which elongation is greatest. Scales are members of the Fibonacci series, e.g. 1,2,3,5,8,13...

`metrics` and `grid` take the same options as in `sequence`. See [`sequence`](@ref).

p sets the percentage of columns sampled (default = 0.1).
