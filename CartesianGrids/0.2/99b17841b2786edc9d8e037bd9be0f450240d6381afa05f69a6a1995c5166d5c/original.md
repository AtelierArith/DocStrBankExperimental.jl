directional_derivative_conserve!(out,f,q)
```

Compute the conservative form of the directional derivative of `f` in the direction of `q`, $\nabla\cdot(qf)$, and put the result into `out`. Note that the result is not scaled by any grid spacing. This form is only appropriate if `q` is divergence free.
