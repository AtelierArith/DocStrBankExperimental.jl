```
complement(x::Region)
```

Calculates the set-theoretic complement of a region.

With a non-complemented region, the runs specify the contained pixels, i.e. they specify what is included within the region. With a complemented region, the runs specify the non-contained pixels, i.e. they specify what is not included within the region.
