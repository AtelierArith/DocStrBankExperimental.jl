This is a pointer to a data structure in the simulation environment that calls the FMU. Using this pointer, data from the modelDescription.xml file [(for example, mapping of valueReferences to variable names)] can be transferred between the simulation environment and the logger function (see [FMISpec 2.0.3] section 2.1.5).
