```
UTMZ(x, y, z = 0.0, zone::Integer, hemisphere::Bool)
```

Universal transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates with zone number. Common projection type for world points. The UTM zone is included in coordinates (see also the `UTM` type).

This type may be used to parameterize UPS coordinates (Universal Polar Stereographic) to accurately represent the polar regions, in zone "0".
