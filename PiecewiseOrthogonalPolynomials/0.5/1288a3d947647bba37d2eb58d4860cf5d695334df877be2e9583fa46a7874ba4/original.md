ContinuousPolynomial{0}  is piecewise Legendre    ContinuousPolynomial{1}  is hat functions in first block and rest are bubble functions Ultraspherical(-1/2)    ContinuousPolynomial{-1} is delta functions (non-boundary) and rest are Ultraspherical(1/2) == diff(Legendre())[:,2:end] in the interior of the elements.    Between elements we are consistent with differentiating Legendre: we have delta functions of (-1)^k on the left and -1 on the right.
