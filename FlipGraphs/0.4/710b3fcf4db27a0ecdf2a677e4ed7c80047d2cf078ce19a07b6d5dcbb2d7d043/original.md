FlipGraphs

A package for **triangulations** of points and their respective **flip graphs**.

So far, this package includes:
- triangulations of **convex polygons** / triangulations of points situated on the border of a disc and their *flip graphs* (with labeled and unlabeled points).
- triangulations of points on a **closed surface** and their respective *modular flip graphs* (with labeled and unlabeled points).
