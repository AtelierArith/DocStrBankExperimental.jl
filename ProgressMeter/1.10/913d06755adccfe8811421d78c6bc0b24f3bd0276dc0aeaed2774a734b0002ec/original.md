`prog = ProgressThresh(thresh; dt=0.1, desc="Progress: ", color=:green, output=stderr)` creates a progress meter for a task which will terminate once a value less than or equal to `thresh` is reached. Output will be generated at intervals at least `dt` seconds apart, and perhaps longer if each iteration takes longer than `dt`. `desc` is a description of the current task. Optionally you can disable the progress meter by setting `enabled=false`. You can also append a per-iteration average duration like "(12.34 ms/it)" to the description by setting `showspeed=true`.
