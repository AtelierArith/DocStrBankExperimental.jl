```
FeatureSelector
```

A model type for constructing a feature selector, based on [unknown.jl](unknown), and implementing the MLJ model interface.

From MLJ, the type can be imported using

```
FeatureSelector = @load FeatureSelector pkg=unknown
```

Do `model = FeatureSelector()` to construct an instance with default hyper-parameters. Provide keyword arguments to override hyper-parameter defaults, as in `FeatureSelector(features=...)`.

Use this model to select features (columns) of a table, usually as part of a model `Pipeline`.

# Training data

In MLJ or MLJBase, bind an instance `model` to data with

```
mach = machine(model, X)
```

where

  * `X`: any table of input features, where "table" is in the sense of Tables.jl

Train the machine using `fit!(mach, rows=...)`.

# Hyper-parameters

  * `features`: one of the following, with the behavior indicated:

      * `[]` (empty, the default): filter out all features (columns) which were not encountered in training
      * non-empty vector of feature names (symbols): keep only the specified features (`ignore=false`) or keep only unspecified features (`ignore=true`)
      * function or other callable: keep a feature if the callable returns `true` on its name. For example, specifying `FeatureSelector(features = name -> name in [:x1, :x3], ignore = true)` has the same effect as `FeatureSelector(features = [:x1, :x3], ignore = true)`, namely to select all features, with the exception of `:x1` and `:x3`.
  * `ignore`: whether to ignore or keep specified `features`, as explained above

# Operations

  * `transform(mach, Xnew)`: select features from the table `Xnew` as specified by the model, taking features seen during training into account, if relevant

# Fitted parameters

The fields of `fitted_params(mach)` are:

  * `features_to_keep`: the features that will be selected

# Example

```
using MLJ

X = (ordinal1 = [1, 2, 3],
     ordinal2 = coerce(["x", "y", "x"], OrderedFactor),
     ordinal3 = [10.0, 20.0, 30.0],
     ordinal4 = [-20.0, -30.0, -40.0],
     nominal = coerce(["Your father", "he", "is"], Multiclass));

selector = FeatureSelector(features=[:ordinal3, ], ignore=true);

julia> transform(fit!(machine(selector, X)), X)
(ordinal1 = [1, 2, 3],
 ordinal2 = CategoricalValue{Symbol,UInt32}["x", "y", "x"],
 ordinal4 = [-20.0, -30.0, -40.0],
 nominal = CategoricalValue{String,UInt32}["Your father", "he", "is"],)

```
