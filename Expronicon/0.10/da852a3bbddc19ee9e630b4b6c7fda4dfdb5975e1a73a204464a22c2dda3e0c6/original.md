```
has_kwfn_constructor(def[, name = struct_name_plain(def)])
```

Check if the struct definition contains keyword function constructor of `name`. The constructor name to check by default is the plain constructor which does not infer any type variables and requires user to input all type variables. See also [`struct_name_plain`](@ref).
