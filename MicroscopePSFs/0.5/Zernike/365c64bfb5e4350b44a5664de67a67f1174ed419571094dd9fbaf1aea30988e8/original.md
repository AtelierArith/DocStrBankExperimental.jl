Zernike
```

Module for working with Zernike polynomials and PSF pupil functions. Provides tools for:

  * Computing Zernike polynomials with Noll normalization (RMS = 1)
  * Converting between Noll and OSA/ANSI indexing schemes
  * Manipulating pupil functions via Zernike coefficients
  * Representing aberrations in optical systems

Note: This module uses Noll indexing and normalization throughout.
