empirical_CI(x,y) --> points, critical_values
```

Extrapolates tables found in the litterature to provide a 95% confidence interval between `start` and `stop`. The confidence interval represents the null hypothesis "no correlations". Provides "ready to plot" confidence interval, by also returning the points at which the critical values are evaluted.
