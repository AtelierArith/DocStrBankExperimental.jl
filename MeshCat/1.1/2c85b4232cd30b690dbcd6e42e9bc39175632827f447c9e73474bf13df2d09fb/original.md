Render a static version of the visualizer, suitable for embedding and offline use. The embedded visualizer includes all geometries, properties, and animations which have been added to the scene, baked into a single HTML document. This document also includes the full compressed MeshCat javascript source files, so it should render properly even after you've exited Julia and even if you have no internet access.

To get access to the raw static HTML representation, see `static_html`
