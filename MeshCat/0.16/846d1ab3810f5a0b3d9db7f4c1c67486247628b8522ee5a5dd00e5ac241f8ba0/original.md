Render a MeshCat visualizer inline in Jupyter, Juno, or VSCode.

If this is the last command in a Jupyter notebook cell, then the visualizer should show up automatically in the corresponding output cell.

If this is run from the Juno console, then the visualizer should show up in the Juno plot pane. Likewise if this is run from VSCode with the julia-vscode extension, then the visualizer should show up in the Julia Plots pane.
