```
MathOptNLSModel(model, F, hessian=true, name="Generic")
```

Construct a `MathOptNLSModel` from a `JuMP` model and a container of JuMP `GenericAffExpr` (generated by @expression) and `NonlinearExpression` (generated by @NLexpression).

`hessian` should be set to `false` for multivariate user-defined functions registered without hessian.
