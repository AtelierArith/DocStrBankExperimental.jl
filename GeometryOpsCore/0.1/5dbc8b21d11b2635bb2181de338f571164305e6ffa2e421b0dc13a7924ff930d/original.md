abstract type Manifold
```

A manifold is mathematically defined as a topological space that resembles Euclidean space locally.

We use the manifold definition to define the space in which an operation should be performed, or where a geometry lies.

Currently we have [`Planar`](@ref), [`Spherical`](@ref), and [`Geodesic`](@ref) manifolds.
