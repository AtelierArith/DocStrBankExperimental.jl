Spherical(; radius)
```

A spherical manifold means that the geometry is on the 3-sphere (but is represented by 2-D longitude and latitude).

!!! note
    The traditional definition of spherical coordinates in physics and mathematics,  $r, \theta, \phi$, uses the *colatitude*, that measures angular displacement from the `z`-axis.  

    Here, we use the geographic definition of longitude and latitude, meaning that `lon` is longitude between -180 and 180, and `lat` is latitude between  `-90` (south pole) and `90` (north pole).
