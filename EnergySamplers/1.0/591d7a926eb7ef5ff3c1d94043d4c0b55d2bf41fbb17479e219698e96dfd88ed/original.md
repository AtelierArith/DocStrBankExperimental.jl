Sampling method for `AbstractSampler`. This method generates samples from the model's learned distribution. 

# Arguments

  * `sampler::AbstractSampler`: The sampler to use.
  * `model`: The model to sample from.
  * `rule::AbstractSamplingRule`: The sampling rule to use.
  * `niter::Int=100`: The number of iterations to perform.
  * `clip_grads::Union{Nothing,AbstractFloat}=nothing`: The value to clip the gradients. This is useful to prevent exploding gradients when training joint energy models. If `nothing`, no clipping is performed.
  * `n_samples::Union{Nothing,Int}=nothing`: The number of samples to generate.
  * `kwargs...`: Additional keyword arguments.

# Returns

  * `input_samples`: The samples generated by the sampler.
