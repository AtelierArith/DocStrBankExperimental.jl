Main module of `Expokit` – Julia implementations of some routines contained in [EXPOKIT](https://www.maths.uq.edu.au/expokit/).

Those routines allow an efficient calculation of the action of matrix exponentials on vectors for large sparse matrices. For more details about the methods see R.B. Sidje, ACM Trans. Math. Softw., 24(1):130-156, 1998 (or its [preprint](https://www.maths.uq.edu.au/expokit/paper.pdf)).
