An `Interval{L,R}(left, right)` where L,R are :open or :closed is an interval set containg `x` such that

1. `left ≤ x ≤ right` if `L == R == :closed`
2. `left < x ≤ right` if `L == :open` and `R == :closed`
3. `left ≤ x < right` if `L == :closed` and `R == :open`, or
4. `left < x < right` if `L == R == :open`
