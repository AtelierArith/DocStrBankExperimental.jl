```
function parallel

Vector a is dimensionally parallel to vector b if
they have the same length and a consistent dimensional
change relates corresponding components.
Guaranteed if two vectors are dimensionally similar.
True for scalars in all cases.

Note: Hart uses â‰ˆ, but this conflicts with an existing Julia function.
