```julia
newton(probPO, orbitguess, defOp, options; kwargs...)

```

This function is similar to `newton(probPO, orbitguess, options, jacobianPO; kwargs...)` except that it uses deflation in order to find periodic orbits different from the ones stored in `defOp`. We refer to the mentioned method for a full description of the arguments. The current method can be used in the vicinity of a Hopf bifurcation to prevent the Newton-Krylov algorithm from converging to the equilibrium point.
