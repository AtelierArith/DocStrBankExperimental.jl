newton(prob, orbitguess, defOp, options; lens, kwargs...)

```

This is the deflated Newton-Krylov Solver for computing a periodic orbit using a (Standard / Poincaré) Shooting method.

# Arguments

Similar to [`newton`](@ref) except that `prob` is either a [`ShootingProblem`](@ref) or a [`PoincareShootingProblem`](@ref).

# Optional argument

  * `jacobian` Specify the choice of the linear algorithm, which must belong to `[AutoDiffMF(), MatrixFree(), AutodiffDense(), AutoDiffDenseAnalytical(), FiniteDifferences(), FiniteDifferencesMF()]`. This is used to select a way of inverting the jacobian dG

      * For `MatrixFree()`, matrix free jacobian, the jacobian is specified by the user in `prob`. This is to be used with an iterative solver (e.g. GMRES) to solve the linear system
      * For `AutoDiffMF()`, we use Automatic Differentiation (AD) to compute the (matrix-free) derivative of `x -> prob(x, p)` using a directional derivative. This is to be used with an iterative solver (e.g. GMRES) to solve the linear system
      * For `AutodiffDense()`. Same as for `AutoDiffMF` but the jacobian is formed as a dense Matrix. You can use a direct solver or an iterative one.
      * For `FiniteDifferences()`, same as for `AutoDiffDense` but we use Finite Differences to compute the jacobian of `x -> prob(x, p)` using the `δ = 1e-8` which can be passed as an argument.
      * For `AutoDiffDenseAnalytical()`. Same as for `AutoDiffDense` but the jacobian is formed using a mix of AD and analytical formula.
      * For `FiniteDifferencesMF()`, use Finite Differences to compute the matrix-free jacobian of `x -> prob(x, p)` using the `δ = 1e-8` which can be passed as an argument.

# Output:

  * solution::NonLinearSolution, see [`NonLinearSolution`](@ref)
