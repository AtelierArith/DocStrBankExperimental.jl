gaussiansmooth3d_phase(phase, sigma=[5,5,5]; weight=1, kwargs...)
```

Smoothes the phase via complex smoothing. A weighting image can be given. The same keyword arguments are supported as in `gaussiansmooth3d`: Base.Docs.DocStr(svec("    gaussiansmooth3d(image)\n\n    gaussiansmooth3d(image, sigma=[5,5,5];\n        mask=nothing,\n        nbox=ifelse(isnothing(mask), 3, 6), \n        weight=nothing, dims=1:min(ndims(image),3), \n        boxsizes=getboxsizes.(sigma, nbox),\n        padding=false\n        )\n\nPerforms Gaussian smoothing on `image` with `sigma` as standard deviation of the Gaussian.\nBy application of `nbox` times running average filters in each dimension.\nThe length of `sigma` and the length of the `dims` that are smoothed have to match. (Default `3`)\n\nOptional arguments:\n- `mask`: Smoothing can be performed using a mask to inter-/extrapolate missing values.\n- `nbox`: Number of box applications. Default is `3` for normal smoothing and `6` for masked smoothing.\n- `weight`: Apply weighted smoothing. Either weighted or masked smoothing can be porformed.\n- `dims`: Specify which dims should be smoothed. Corresponds to manually looping of the other dimensions.\n- `boxizes`: Manually specify the boxsizes, not using the provided sigma. `length(boxsizes)==length(dims) && length(boxsizes[1])==nbox`\n- `padding`: If `true`, the image is padded with zeros before smoothing and the padding is removed afterwards.\n"), nothing, Dict{Symbol, Any}(:typesig => Union{}, :module => MriResearchTools, :linenumber => 1, :binding => MriResearchTools.gaussiansmooth3d!, :path => "/Users/atelierarith/.julia/packages/MriResearchTools/4JdaA/src/smoothing.jl"))
