```
algorithm3!(p::Vector{T}, u::Real) where {T<:Real}
```

Normalize `p` to probabilities, spreading probability mass `u` across the 0 or more elements of `p` which are equal to zero. If all values of `w` are zero and `u â‰  0`, `p` will be filled with uniform probability mass. Note that `T` must be a type which is able to hold the result of `inv(one(T))`.
