Calculate densities for the ortho (symmetric) and para (anti-symmetric) spin-isomers of molecular hydrogen (H2) from a total molecule density. The ortho-to-para ratio assumes that the H2 was formed in thermal equillibrium at the give kinetic temperature. In the high-temperature limit (> 100 K) the ortho-to-para ratio is 3.
