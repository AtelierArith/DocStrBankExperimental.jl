two_sum(a, b)
```

Computes `hi = fl(a+b)` and `lo = err(a+b)`, using the algorithm by D. E. Knuth, "The Art of Computer Programming: Seminumerical Algorithms", 1969.

This algorithm does not use any branch. See also `fast_two_sum` for an alternative algorithm which branches but does fewer arithmetic operations.
