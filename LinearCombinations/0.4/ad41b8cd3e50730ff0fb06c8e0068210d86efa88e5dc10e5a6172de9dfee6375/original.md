LinearCombinations.Regroup{A, B}
```

Applying a `Regroup` object to a Tensor or a linear combinations of tensors rearranges the components of the tensor. Use `regroup` to create a `Regroup` object. It is possible to define additional methods to apply `Regroup` objects to other arguments besides tensors.

See also [`regroup`](@ref).
