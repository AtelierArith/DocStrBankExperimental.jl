```
large_type(str)
```

Return a string of Unicode glyphs that will display the `str` as "Large Type". Each glyph is made up to 9 small pieces.

Like the other functions, the current font should have these characters  (at Unicode points range U+1CE1A to U+1CE50) otherwise you probably won't sequence anything.
