```
fluxinfo(r::Vector, z::Vector, psi::Matrix)
```

Calculates quantities derived from the flux map: R,Z, and polidal field components, and discriminant for distinguishing minima and maxima from saddle points.

r: major radius in machine cylindrical coordinate system / m z: height above midplane / m psi: polidal magnetic flux / T m^2
