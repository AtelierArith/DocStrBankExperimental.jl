energy evaluations along a path in the String/NEB-type methods can be performed in a 'serial' manner or in a 'palindrome' manner:

  * `serial` : traverse path always in the same direction.
  * `palindrome` : the order of computing the energy of the images along a path is reversed after each iteration.

### Parameters:

  * `direction` : order of traversing the images along the path
