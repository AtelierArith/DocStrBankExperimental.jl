GridTraining(dx)
```

A training strategy that uses the grid points in a multidimensional grid with spacings `dx`. If the grid is multidimensional, then `dx` is expected to be an array of `dx` values matching the dimension of the domain, corresponding to the grid spacing in each dimension.

## Positional Arguments

  * `dx`: the discretization of the grid.
