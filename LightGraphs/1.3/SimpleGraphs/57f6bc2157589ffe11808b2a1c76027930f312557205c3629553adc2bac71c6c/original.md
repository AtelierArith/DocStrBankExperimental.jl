StochasticBlockModel{T,P}
```

A type capturing the parameters of the SBM. Each vertex is assigned to a block and the probability of edge `(i,j)` depends only on the block labels of vertex `i` and vertex `j`.

The assignement is stored in nodemap and the block affinities a `k` by `k` matrix is stored in affinities.

`affinities[k,l]` is the probability of an edge between any vertex in block `k` and any vertex in block `l`.

### Implementation Notes

Graphs are generated by taking random $i,j âˆˆ V$ and flipping a coin with probability `affinities[nodemap[i],nodemap[j]]`.
