calibratefrompairwisedistances!(net, distances::Matrix{Float64},
    taxon_names::Vector{<:AbstractString})
```

Calibrate the network to match (as best as possible) input pairwise distances between taxa, such as observed from sequence data. `taxon_names` should provide the list of taxa, in the same order in which they they are considered in the `distances` matrix. The optimization criterion is the sum of squares between the observed distances, and the distances from the network (weighted average of tree distances, weighted by Î³'s). The network's edge lengths are modified.

Warning: for many networks, mutiple calibrations can fit the pairwise distance data equally well (lack of identifiability). This function will output *one* of these equally good calibrations.

optional arguments (default):

  * checkpreorder (true)
  * forceMinorLength0 (false) to force minor hybrid edges to have a length of 0
  * ultrametric (true) to force the network to be

      * time-consistent: all paths from the root to a given node must have the same length, so the age of this node is well-defined, and
      * ultrametric: all tips are at the same distance from the root, so have the same age.
  * NLoptMethod (`:LD_MMA`) for the optimization algorithm. Other options include `:LN_COBYLA` (derivative-free); see NLopt package.
  * tolerance values to control when the optimization is stopped: ftolRel (1e-12), ftolAbs (1e-10) on the criterion, and xtolRel (1e-10), xtolAbs (1e-10) on branch lengths / divergence times.
  * verbose (false)
