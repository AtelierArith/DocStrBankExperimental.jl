```
pairwisetaxondistancematrix(net; keepInternal=false,
                            checkpreorder=true, nodeAges=[])
pairwisetaxondistancematrix!(M, net, nodeAges)
```

Return the matrix `M` of pairwise distances between nodes in the network:

  * between all nodes (internal and leaves) if `keepInternal=true`, in which case the nodes are listed in `M` in the order in which they appear in `net.vec_node`
  * between taxa only otherwise, in which case the nodes are listed in `M` in the order in which they appear in `tiplabels(net)` (i.e. same order as in `net.leaf`)

The second form modifies `M` in place, assuming all nodes.

The distance between the root and a given hybrid node (to take an example) is the weighted average of path lengths from the root to that node, where each path is weighted by the product of Î³s of all edges on that path. This distance measures the average genetic distance across the genome, if branch lengths are in substitutions/site.

optional arguments:

  * `checkpreorder`: if true, `net.vec_node` is updated to get a topological ordering of nodes.
  * `nodeAges`: if not provided, i.e. empty vector, the network is *not* modified.   If provided and non-empty, `nodeAges` should list node ages in the pre-order in which nodes are listed in `vec_node` (including leaves), and **edge lengths** in `net` **are modified** accordingly.

Providing node ages hence makes the network time consistent: such that all paths from the root to a given hybrid node have the same length. If node ages are not provided, the network need not be time consistent.
