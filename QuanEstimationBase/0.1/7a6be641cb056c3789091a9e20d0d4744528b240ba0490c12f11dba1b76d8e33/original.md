```
SIC(dim::Int64)
```

Generation of a set of rank-one symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measure (SIC-POVM).

  * `dim`: The dimension of the system.

Note: SIC-POVM is calculated by the Weyl-Heisenberg covariant SIC-POVM fiducial state which can be downloaded from [here](http://www.physics.umb.edu/Research/QBism/solutions.html).
