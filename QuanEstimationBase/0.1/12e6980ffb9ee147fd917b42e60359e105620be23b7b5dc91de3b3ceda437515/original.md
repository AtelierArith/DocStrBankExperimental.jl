```
SCMopt(psi=nothing, ctrl=nothing, M=nothing, ctrl_bound=[-Inf, Inf], seed=1234)
```

State, control and measurement optimization.

  * `psi`: Guessed probe state.
  * `ctrl`: Guessed control coefficients.
  * `M`: Guessed projective measurement (a set of basis).
  * `ctrl_bound`:  Lower and upper bounds of the control coefficients.
  * `seed`: Random seed.
