```
newell_patch(k::Union{QQField, QQBarFieldElem}, n::Int=1)
```

Let $n$ be an integer between 1 and 32. Returns the ideal corresponding to  the implicitization of the $n$-th bi-cubic patch describing the Newell's teapot as a parametric surface.

The specific generators for each patch have been taken from [Tran:2004](@cite).
