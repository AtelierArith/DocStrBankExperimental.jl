```
DiBitVector(n::Integer, v::Integer)
```

Create a `DiBitVector` with `n` elements preinitialized to a value `v` from `0` to `3`, inclusive.

A `DiBitVector` is a vector whose elements are two bits wide, allowing storage of integer values between 0 and 3. This structure is optimized for performance and memory savings for large numbers of elements.
