SortedDict(iter, o=Forward)
```

and `SortedDict{K,V}(iter, o=Forward)`

Construct a `SortedDict` from an arbitrary iterable object of `key=>value` pairs. If `K` and `V` are not specified, the key type and value type are inferred from the given iterable. The ordering object `o` defaults to `Forward`.
