```
RobinDict([itr])
```

`RobinDict{K,V}()` constructs a hash table with keys of type `K` and values of type `V`. Keys are compared with [`isequal`](@ref) and hashed with [`hash`](@ref). Given a single iterable argument, constructs a [`RobinDict`](@ref) whose key-value pairs are taken from 2-tuples `(key,value)` generated by the argument.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> RobinDict([("A", 1), ("B", 2)])
RobinDict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "B" => 2
  "A" => 1
```

Alternatively, a sequence of pair arguments may be passed.

```jldoctest
julia> RobinDict("A"=>1, "B"=>2)
RobinDict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "B" => 2
  "A" => 1
```
