```
mean(B, f[, lvl=1])
```

Returns an estimate for the mean value of `f`, where `f` is a function acting on the sample pushed the error porpagator. `f` must be of the form `f(v)`, where `v = [mean_arg1, mean_arg2, ..., mean_argN]` is a vector containing the averages of each argument pushed to the error propagator.
