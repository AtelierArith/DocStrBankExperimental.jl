```
img = testimage(filename; download_only=false, [ops...]
```

Load image from the DIP3E textbook that partially matches `filename` in case-insensitive manner.

If `download_only=true`, the full filepath is returned. Any other keyword `ops` will be passed to image IO backend through `FileIO.load`.

# Example

```julia
julia> using TestImages
julia> img = testimage_dip3e("cameraman") # matches Fig0222(b)(cameraman).tif
julia> img = testimage_dip3e("fig0222(a)")
```
