```
generate_GR(num_dims, sum_dims_arr, weights, ind1, ind2)
```

Generate the Tullio statement for computing the Good's roughness. `num_dims` is the dimension of the array. `sum_dims_arr` is a array indicating over which dimensions we must sum over. `weights` is a array of a weight for the different dimension. `ind1` and `ind2` are the offsets for the difference.
