This function decides whether a particular distribution can be sampled faster and more accurately using its cumulative distribution function or using the log of its cumulative distribution function, also called the integrated hazard. The former is used for the Next Reaction method by Gibson and Bruck. The latter is used by the Modified Next Reaction method of Anderson. We are calling the first a linear space and the second a logarithmic space.
