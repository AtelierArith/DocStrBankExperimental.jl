```
 γ = fdimmperf(sysr::FDIFilterIF, SFDI[, nrmflag])
```

Compute the model-matching performance `γ` of the stable fault detection and isolation  filter internal form object `sysr::FDIFilterIF` and the associated binary structure matrix `SFDI`.  The filter `sysr` consists of `N` individual FDI filters `sysr.sys[i]`, for `i = 1, ..., N`, where `sysr.sys[i][:,sysr.faults]` is the fault to residual channel of the `i`-th filter  with the corresponding transfer function matrix `Rfi(λ)` and `sysr.sys[i][:,sysr.noise]` is the noise to residual channel of the `i`-th filter  with the corresponding transfer function matrix `Rwi(λ)`. Then,  `γ` is an `N`-dimensional vector whose `i`-th component is the  H∞-norm of `[Rfdi(λ) Rwi(λ)]`, if `nrmflag = Inf` (default)  or the  H2-norm of `[Rfdi(λ) Rwi(λ)]`, if `nrmflag = 2`, where `Rfdi(λ)` is the transfer function matrix whose `j`-th column is  zero if `SFDI[i,j] = 1` and is equal to the `j`-th column of `Rfi(λ)` if `SFDI[i,j] = 0`.  The `i`-th component of `γ` is infinite for an unstable filter or if `nrmflag = 2` and the transfer function matrix `[Rfdi(λ) Rwi(λ)]` of a continuous-time system is not strictly proper.
