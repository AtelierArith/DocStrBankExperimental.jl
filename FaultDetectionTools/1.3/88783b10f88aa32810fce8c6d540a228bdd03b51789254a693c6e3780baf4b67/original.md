 fdiscond(sysr::FDFilterIF, SFDI, freq) -> (scond, β, γ)
```

Compute the detection and isolation sensitivity condition vector `scond` (and related quatities `β` and `γ`) for the `q × mf` binary structure matrix `SFDI` associated to the stable transfer function matrix `Rf(λ)` of the transfer channel from the fault inputs to residuals of the fault detection filter internal form object `sysr::FDFilterIF`.  The filter `sysr` consists of `N` individual FDI filters `sysr.sys[i]`, for `i = 1, ..., N`, where `sysr.sys[i][:,sysr.faults]` is the fault to residual channel of the `i`-th filter and  `Rfi(λ)` is the corresponding transfer function matrix.  The global transfer function matrix `Rf(λ)` is formed by row concatenation of the  transfer function matrices of the `N` individual filters, i.e.,  `Rf(λ) := [ Rf1(λ); Rf2(λ); ...; RfN(λ)]`. The i-th element of the vectors `scond`, `β` and `γ` contain the quantities:  `β[i]` - the H∞- index of the nonzero columns of `Rffi(λ)`, `γ` - the maximum of the nonzero columns norms of `Rfi(λ)` and  the correspomding fault detection sensitivity condition `scond[i]` evaluated as `scond[i] := β[i]/γ[i]`, where `Rffi(λ)` is formed of those `j`-th  columns of the `i`-th row of `Rf(λ)` for which `S[i,j] = 1` and  `Rfi(λ)` is the `i`-th row of `Rf(λ)`.  It is assumed that for each `j` such that `SFDI[i,j] = 1`, the `j`-th column of `Rfi(λ)` is nonzero  and  for each `j` such that `SFDI[i,j] = 0`, the `j`-th column of `Rfi(λ)` is zero.  If `freq` is a vector of real frequency values, then `β[i]` and `γ[i]` are evaluated over the frequencies contained in `freq`.
