```
 γ = fdimmperf(sysr::FDIFilterIF, sysref::FDIFilterIF[, nrmflag])
```

Compute the model-matching performance `γ` of the fault detection and isolation filter internal form object `sysr::FDIFilterIF` with respect to the fault detection and isolation reference filter internal form  `sysref::FDIFilterIF`.  If `Ri(λ)` is the transfer function matrix of the `i`-th fault detection and isolation filter internal form    `sysr.sys[i]` and `Mri(λ)` is the transfer function matrix of the `i`-th fault detection and isolation reference filter internal form    `sysref.sys[i]`, then `γ` is a vector whose `i`-th component `γ[i]` is the  H∞-norm of `Ri(λ)-Mri(λ)`, if `nrmflag = Inf` (default) or the  H2-norm of `Ri(λ)-Mri(λ)`, if `nrmflag = 2`. The value of `γ[i]` is infinite for an unstable difference `Ri(λ)-Mri(λ)` or if `nrmflag = 2` and the transfer function matrix `Ri(λ)-Mri(λ)` of a continuous-time system is not strictly proper. In general, `Ri(λ)` and `Mri(λ)` are partitioned as `Ri(λ) = [ Rui(λ) Rdi(λ) Rfi(λ) Rwi(λ) Rai(λ) ]` and `Mri(λ) = [ Mrui(λ) Mrdi(λ) Mrfi(λ) Mrwi(λ) Mrai(λ) ]` in accordance with  the partitioning of the inputs in control inputs, disturbance inputs, fault inputs, noise inputs and auxiliary inputs. Void components of `Mri(λ)` corresponding to non-void components in `Ri(λ)` are assumed to be zero.
