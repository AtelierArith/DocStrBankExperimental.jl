 fdif2ngap(sysr::FDIFilterIF, SFDI, freq; atol = √ϵ) -> (gap, β, γ)
```

Compute the fault-to-noise gap  `gap` (and the related quatities `β` and `γ`) for the `N × mf` binary structure matrix `SFDI` associated to the stable global transfer function matrices `Rf(λ)` and `Rw(λ)` of the transfer channels from the fault inputs to residuals and noise inputs to residuals, respectively,  of the fault detection and isolation filter internal form object `sysr::FDIFilterIF`.  The filter `sysr` consists of `N` individual FDI filters `sysr.sys[i]`, for `i = 1, ..., N`, where `sysr.sys[i][:,sysr.faults]` is the fault to residual channel of the `i`-th filter  with the corresponding transfer function matrix `Rfi(λ)` and `sysr.sys[i][:,sysr.noise]` is the noise to residual channel of the `i`-th filter  with the corresponding transfer function matrix `Rwi(λ)`.    The global transfer function matrices `Rf(λ)` and `Rw(λ)` are formed by row concatenation of the  transfer function matrices of the `N` individual filters, i.e.,  `Rf(λ) := [ Rf1(λ); Rf2(λ); ...; RfN(λ)]` and  `Rw(λ) := [ Rw1(λ); Rw2(λ); ...; RwN(λ)]`  Let  `Rffi(λ)` be the transfer function matrix formed of those `j`-th columns of `Rfi(λ)`  for which `SFDI[i,j] = 1` and let `Rdfi(λ)` be the transfer function matrix formed of those `j`-th columns of `Rfi(λ)`  for which `SFDI[i,j] = 0`.  The `i`-th element of the vectors `gap`, `β` and `γ` contain the quantities:  `β[i]` - the H∞- index of `Rffi(λ)`, `γ[i]` - the H∞-norm of `[Rdfi(λ) Rwi(λ)]` and  the fault-to-noise gap `gap` evaluated as `gap[i] := β[i]/γ[i]`.  `gap[i] = ∞` if `[Rdfi(λ) Rwi(λ)] = 0` and `gap[i] = 0` if `Rffi(λ) = 0`. If `freq` is a vector of real frequency values, then `β[i]` and `γ[i]` are evaluated over the frequencies contained in `freq`.  `atol` is an absolute tolerance for the norms `Rwi(λ)`, such that norm values less than or equal to `atol` are  considered zero (default:  `√ϵ`, where `ϵ` is the working machine precision.)
