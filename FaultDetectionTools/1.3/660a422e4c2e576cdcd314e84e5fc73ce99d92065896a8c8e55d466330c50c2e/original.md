```
 γ = fdimmperf(sysr::FDFilterIF, sysref::Union{FDFilterIF,FDIModel}[, nrmflag])
```

Compute the model-matching performance `γ` of the fault detection filter internal form object `sysr::FDFilterIF` with respect to the fault detection reference filter internal form  `sysref::FDFilterIF`.  If `R(λ)` is the transfer function matrix of the fault detection filter internal form    `sysr.sys` and `Mr(λ)` is the transfer function matrix of the fault detection reference filter internal form    `sysref.sys`, then `γ` is the  H∞-norm of `R(λ)-Mr(λ)`, if `nrmflag = Inf` (default) or the  H2-norm of `R(λ)-Mr(λ)`, if `nrmflag = 2`. The value of `γ` is infinite for an unstable difference `R(λ)-Mr(λ)` or if `nrmflag = 2` and the transfer function matrix `R(λ)-Mr(λ)` of a continuous-time system is not strictly proper. In general, `R(λ)` and `Mr(λ)` are partitioned as `R(λ) = [ Ru(λ) Rd(λ) Rf(λ) Rw(λ) Ra(λ) ]` and `Mr(λ) = [ Mru(λ) Mrd(λ) Mrf(λ) Mrw(λ) Mra(λ) ]` in accordance with  the partitioning of the inputs in control inputs, disturbance inputs, fault inputs, noise inputs and auxiliary inputs. Void components of `Mr(λ)` corresponding to non-void components in `R(λ)` are assumed to be zero.
