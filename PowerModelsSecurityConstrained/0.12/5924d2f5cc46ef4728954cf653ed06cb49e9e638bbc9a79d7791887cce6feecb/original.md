An SCOPF formulation conforming to the ARPA-e GOC Challenge 1 specification. A DC power flow approximation is used. Power balance and line flow constraints are strictly enforced in the first stage.  Contingency branch flow constraints are enforced by PTDF cuts and penalized based on a conservative linear approximation of the formulation's specification.

This formulation is used in conjunction with the contingency filters that generate PTDF cuts.
