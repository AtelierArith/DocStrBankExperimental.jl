An academic SCOPF formulation inspired by the ARPA-e GOC Challenge 1 specification. Power balance and line flow constraints are strictly enforced in the first stage and contingency stages. Contingency branch flow constraints are enforced by PTDF cuts using the DC power flow approximation.

This formulation is used in conjunction with the contingency filters that generate PTDF cuts.
