```
EvoSplineRegressor(; kwargs...)
```

A model type for constructing a EvoSplineRegressor, based on [EvoLinear.jl](https://github.com/jeremiedb/EvoLinear.jl), and implementing both an internal API and the MLJ model interface.

# Keyword arguments

  * `loss=:mse`: loss function to be minimised.    Can be one of:

      * `:mse`
      * `:logistic`
      * `:poisson`
      * `:gamma`
      * `:tweedie`
  * `nrounds=10`: maximum number of training rounds.
  * `eta=1`: Learning rate. Typically in the range `[1e-2, 1]`.
  * `L1=0`: Regularization penalty applied by shrinking to 0 weight update if update is < L1. No penalty if update > L1. Results in sparse feature selection. Typically in the `[0, 1]` range on normalized features.
  * `L2=0`: Regularization penalty applied to the squared of the weight update value. Restricts large parameter values. Typically in the `[0, 1]` range on normalized features.
  * `rng=123`: random seed. Not used at the moment.
  * `updater=:all`: training method. Only `:all` is supported at the moment. Gradients for each feature are computed simultaneously, then bias is updated based on all features update.
  * `device=:cpu`: Only `:cpu` is supported at the moment.

# Internal API

Do `config = EvoSplineRegressor()` to construct an hyper-parameter struct with default hyper-parameters. Provide keyword arguments as listed above to override defaults, for example:

```julia
EvoSplineRegressor(loss=:logistic, L1=1e-3, L2=1e-2, nrounds=100)
```

## Training model

A model is built using [`fit`](@ref):

```julia
config = EvoSplineRegressor()
m = fit(config; x, y, w)
```

## Inference

Fitted results is an `EvoLinearModel` which acts as a prediction function when passed a features matrix as argument.  

```julia
preds = m(x)
```

# MLJ Interface

From MLJ, the type can be imported using:

```julia
EvoSplineRegressor = @load EvoSplineRegressor pkg=EvoLinear
```

Do `model = EvoLinearRegressor()` to construct an instance with default hyper-parameters. Provide keyword arguments to override hyper-parameter defaults, as in `EvoSplineRegressor(loss=...)`.

## Training model

In MLJ or MLJBase, bind an instance `model` to data with `mach = machine(model, X, y)` where: 

  * `X`: any table of input features (eg, a `DataFrame`) whose columns each have one of the following element scitypes: `Continuous`, `Count`, or `<:OrderedFactor`; check column scitypes with `schema(X)`
  * `y`: is the target, which can be any `AbstractVector` whose element scitype is `<:Continuous`; check the scitype with `scitype(y)`

Train the machine using `fit!(mach, rows=...)`.

## Operations

  * `predict(mach, Xnew)`: return predictions of the target given

features `Xnew` having the same scitype as `X` above. Predictions   are deterministic.

## Fitted parameters

The fields of `fitted_params(mach)` are:

  * `:fitresult`: the `SplineModel` object returned by EvoSplineRegressor fitting algorithm.

## Report

The fields of `report(mach)` are:

  * `:coef`: Vector of coefficients (Î²s) associated to each of the features.
  * `:bias`: Value of the bias.
  * `:names`: Names of each of the features.
