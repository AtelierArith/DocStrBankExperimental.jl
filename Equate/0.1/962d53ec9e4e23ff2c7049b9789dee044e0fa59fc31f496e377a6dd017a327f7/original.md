BraunHolland(X::NEAT, Y::NEAT; w₁ = length(X.rawX) / (length(X.rawX) + length(Y.rawX)), w₂ = 1.0 - w₁)
```

Conduct Braun-Holland Linear equating, which use means and standard deviations estimated by the synsetic population distributions.

# Arguments

  * `X` frequency table generated by `freqtab(X, V)`, `V` is the test score of common item part
  * `Y` same as above.
  * `w₁`, `w₂` The synsetic population weights, that are constrained to be w₁ + w₂ = 1.
