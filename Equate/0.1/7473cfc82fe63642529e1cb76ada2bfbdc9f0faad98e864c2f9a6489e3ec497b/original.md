```
A Julia package for test equating.
```

Major features:

*Single Group (SG)* design

  * `Linear` provides the linear equating.
  * `Equipercentile` provides the equipercentile equating.

*Non Equivalent group with Anchor Test (NEAT) design*

  * `Tucker`
  * `ChainedLinear`
  * `ChainedEquipercentile`
  * `BraunHolland`
  * `FrequencyEstimation`

and more...

According to von Davier, Holland, and Thayer (2004), the test equating has separate 5 steps.

  * First step, *Pre-smoothing*.
  * Second step is *Estimating the score probabilities*.
  * Third step is *Continuization*.
  * Fourth step is *Equating*.
  * Fifth, last step is *Calculating the Standard Error of Equating(SEE)*.
