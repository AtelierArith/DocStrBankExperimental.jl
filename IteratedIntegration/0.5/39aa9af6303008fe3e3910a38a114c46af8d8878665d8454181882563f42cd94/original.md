A package for iterated adaptive integration (IAI) based on [`QuadGK.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaMath/QuadGK.jl). Its main exports are [`nested_quad`](@ref), a routine which performs multidimensional adaptive integration with nested `quadgk` calls and the [`AbstractIteratedLimits`](@ref) abstraction to evaluate parametrizations of limits of integration.
