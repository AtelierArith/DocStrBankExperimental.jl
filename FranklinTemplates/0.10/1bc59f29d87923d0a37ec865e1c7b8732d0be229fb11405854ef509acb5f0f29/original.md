```
addtemplate(path)
```

Assuming you're working with FranklinTemplates on development mode (i.e. `] dev FranklinTemplates` this function takes a path where you would have worked on a template and incorporates it into FranklinTemplates, putting files at the right place; this makes iterations and PRs easier.

Note: if you use this without FranklinTemplates on dev mode, bad things will likely occur.
