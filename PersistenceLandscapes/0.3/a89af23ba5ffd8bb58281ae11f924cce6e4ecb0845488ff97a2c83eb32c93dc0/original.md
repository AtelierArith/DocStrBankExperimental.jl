Structure to hold information about persistence barcodes:

  * barcodes- vector where elements are barcodes. Each barcodes is a pair of   numbers, where first one is the birth time, second one is the death time
  * dimensionOfBarcode - is the dimension for which all of the barcodes were generated

TODO rename MyPair to Point2D TODO create a structure Barcode from Point2D (a level of abstraction)
