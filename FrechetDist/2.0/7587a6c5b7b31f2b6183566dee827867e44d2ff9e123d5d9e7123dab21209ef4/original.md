A parameterization is a polygonal curve that starts at (0,0) and
end at (m,n).  The polygonal curve either have positive slope edge,
or vertical or horizontal edges. It can be thought of as a
piecewise linear function from [0,m] to [0,n]. Here m and n are the
lengths of the two given polygons of P and Q, respectively.
