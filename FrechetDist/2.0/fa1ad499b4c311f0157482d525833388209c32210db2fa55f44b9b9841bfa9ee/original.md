frechet_dist_upper_bound
```

Returns a rough upper bound on the Frechet distance between the two curves. This upper bound is on the continuous distance. No guarenteee on how bad the approximation is. This is used as a starting point for real approximation of the Frechet distance, and should not be used otherwise.
