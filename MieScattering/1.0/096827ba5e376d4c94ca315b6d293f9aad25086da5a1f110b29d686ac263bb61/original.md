generate_mie_costheta(μ_cdf)
```

Generate a new scattering angle using a cdf. A uniformly spaced cumulative distribution function (CDF) is needed. New random angles are generated by selecting a random interval μ[i] to μ[i+1] and choosing an angle uniformly distributed over the interval.

# Parameters:

  * `μ_cdf`: a cumulative distribution function

# Output:

  * an array of random scattering angle cosines based on the CDF supplied.
