Obtains an orthogonal basis based on the snapshot matrix S ∈ R^(N × m) by calculating an EVD of S' * S (size: m × m) The size of the basis is set as k.  If k = 0 is given, the size is determined by the tolerance parameter as 1 - tol < (E(k) + Λ[k+1])/E(N) where E(k) is the sum of the largest k eigenvalues of the snapshot matrix. Returns the k largest left eigenvectors in the N × k matrix Ψ and the corresponding eigenvalues in Λ
