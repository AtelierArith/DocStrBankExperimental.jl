Obtains an orthogonal basis based on the snapshot matrix XV = [X V] ∈ R^(N × 2m) by calculating an EVD of XV' * XV (size: 2m × 2m) The size of the basis is set as k.  If k = 0 is given, the size is determined by the tolerance parameter as 1 - tol < (E(k) + Λ[k+1])/E(N) where E(k) is the sum of the largest k eigenvalues of the snapshot matrix. Returns the k largest left eigenvectors in the N × k matrix Ψ and the corresponding eigenvalues in Λ
