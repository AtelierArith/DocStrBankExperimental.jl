```
ChineseDictionary([filename])
```

Load a text-based dictionary either from the default dictionary file or from the provided filename. The format of the text file must be the same as [that used by the CC-CEDICT project](https://cc-cedict.org/wiki/format:syntax) for compatibility reasons.

For general use, it's the easiest to just use the default dictionary (from the CC-CEDICT project). This is loaded if you don't specify a filename. This dictionary is updated from the official project page every so often.
