Copy parts from a C-set to a Câ€²-set.

The selected parts must belong to both schemas. All subparts common to the selected parts, including data attributes, are preserved. Thus, if the selected parts form a sub-C-set, then the whole sub-C-set is preserved. On the other hand, if the selected parts do *not* form a sub-C-set, then some copied parts will have undefined subparts.
