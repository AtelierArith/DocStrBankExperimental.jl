Returns a function that when invoked, will only be triggered at most once during `timeout` seconds. Normally, the throttled function will run as much as it can, without ever going more than once per `wait` duration; but if you'd like to disable the execution on the leading edge, pass `leading=false`. To enable execution on the trailing edge, ditto.
