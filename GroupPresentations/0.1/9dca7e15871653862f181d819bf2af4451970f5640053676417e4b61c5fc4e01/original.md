`Go(P::Presentation[,silent])`

`Go`  performs Tietze transformations on a  presentation `P`. It is perhaps the  most convenient of the  interactive Tietze transformation commands. It offers  a  kind  of  default  strategy  which,  in  general, saves you from explicitly calling the lower-level commands it involves.

Roughly  speaking, `Go` consists of a  loop over a procedure which involves two  phases:  In  the  *search  phase*  it calls `Search` and `SearchEqual` described  below which  try to  reduce the  relator lengths by substituting common  subwords  of  relators,  in  the  *elimination  phase* it calls the command  `Eliminate` described below  (or, more precisely,  a subroutine of `Eliminate`  in order to save some  administrative overhead) which tries to eliminate  generators  that  can  be  expressed  as  words in the remaining generators.

If  `Go`  succeeds  in  reducing  the  number  of generators, the number of relators,  or the total  length of all  relators, then it  displays the new status  before returning (provided that you did  not set the print level to zero).  However, it does not  provide any output if  all these three values have  remained unchanged,  even if  the `SearchEqual`  command involved has changed  the  presentation  such  that  another  call of `Go` might provide further  progress. Hence, in such a case  it makes sense to repeat the call of  the command for  several times (or  to call instead  the `GoGo` command which we will describe next).

As an example  we  compute  a presentation of a  subgroup of index 408 in `PSL(2,17)`.

Note that the number  of loops over the two phases as well  as the number of  subword   searches  or  generator  eliminations  in  each  phase  are determined by a set of option parameters which may  heavily influence the resulting presentation and the computing time (see Tietze options below).

`Go` is just another name  for the  `simplify` command.  It has  been introduced for  the convenience  of those {GAP} users  who are used to  that  name from the *go* option of the ANU Tietze transformation stand-alone program or from the *go* command in SPAS.

If "silent" is specified as true, then the printing of the status line by `Go` in case of T.debug=1 is suppressed.
