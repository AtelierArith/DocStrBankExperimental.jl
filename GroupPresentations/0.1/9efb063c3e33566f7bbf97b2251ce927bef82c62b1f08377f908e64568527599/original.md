`Presentation( G::FpGroup[, debug=1])`

returns  the  presentation  corresponding  to  the given finitely presented group `G`.

The  optional `debug` parameter  can be used  to restrict or  to extend the amount  of output  provided by  Tietze transformation  functions when being applied  to the created  presentation. The default  value 1 is designed for interactive  use and implies  explicit messages to  be displayed by most of these functions. A `debug` value of 0 will suppress these messages, whereas a `debug` value of 2 will enforce some additional output.
