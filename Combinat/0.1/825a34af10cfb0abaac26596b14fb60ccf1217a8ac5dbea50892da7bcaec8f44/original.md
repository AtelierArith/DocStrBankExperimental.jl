`gcd_partitions(p1,â€¦,pn)`

Each  argument is  a partition  of the  same set  `S`, given  as a  list of disjoint  vectors whose  union is  `S`. Equivalently  each argument  can be interpreted as an equivalence relation on `S`.

The result is the coarsest partition which refines all argument partitions. It  represents the  'and' of  the equivalence  relations represented by the arguments.
