`lcm_partitions(p1,â€¦,pn)`

each  argument is  a partition  of the  same set  `S`, given  as a  list of disjoint  vectors whose  union is  `S`. Equivalently  each argument  can be interpreted as an equivalence relation on `S`.

The result is the finest partition of `S` such that each argument partition refines it. It represents the 'or' of the equivalence relations represented by the arguments.
