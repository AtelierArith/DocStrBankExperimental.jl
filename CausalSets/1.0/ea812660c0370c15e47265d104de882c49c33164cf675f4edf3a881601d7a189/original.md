ConformallyMinkowskianManifold{N} <: ConformallyTimesliceableManifold{N}
```

Supertype for $N-1$-dimensional conformally Minkowskian manifolds, defined as manifolds whose metric can be brought into the form

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{d} s^2 = F \left( -\mathrm{d}t^2 + \sum_i \mathrm{d} x_i^2 \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

where $F$ is the conformal factor.
