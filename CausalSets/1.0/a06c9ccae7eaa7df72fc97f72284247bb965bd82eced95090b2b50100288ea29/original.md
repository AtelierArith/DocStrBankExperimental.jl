```
proper_time_sq_between(manifold, x, y) -> Float64
```

Return the square of the integrated line element of the shortest geodesic between $x$ and $y$, i.e. the proper time squared between $x$ and $y$. If the separation between $x$ and $y$ is spacelike, the resulting value will be negative, i.e. minus the spacelike distance squared.
