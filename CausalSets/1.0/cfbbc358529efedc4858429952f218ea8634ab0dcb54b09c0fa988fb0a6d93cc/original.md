Supertype for $N-1$-dimensional conformally hypercylindrical manifolds, defined as manifolds whose metric can be brought into the form

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{d}s^2 = F \left( -\mathrm{d}t^2 + \mathrm{d} Ω_{N-1}^2 \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

where $F$ is the conformal factor, and $\mathrm{d} Ω_{N-1}^2$ is the standard $N-1$-sphere line element.
