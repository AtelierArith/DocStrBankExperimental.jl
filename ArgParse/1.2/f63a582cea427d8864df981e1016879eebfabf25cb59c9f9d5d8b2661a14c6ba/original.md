```
ArgParse
```

This module allows the creation of user-friendly command-line interfaces to Julia programs: the program defines which arguments, options and sub-commands it accepts, and the `ArgParse` module does the actual parsing, issues errors when the input is invalid, and automatically generates help and usage messages.

Users familiar with Python's `argparse` module will find many similarities, but some important differences as well.
