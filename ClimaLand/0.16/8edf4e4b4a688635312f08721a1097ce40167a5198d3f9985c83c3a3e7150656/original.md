```
FieldMatrixWithSolver(Y::ClimaCore.Fields.FieldVector)
```

Outer constructor for the FieldMatrixWithSolver Jacobian matrix struct. This extends the constructor from ClimaCore.FieldMatrix, filling the object with ClimaLand-specific values.

For variables that will be stepped implicitly, the Jacobian matrix is a tridiagonal matrix. For variables that will be stepped explicitly, the Jacobian matrix is a negative identity matrix.

To run a model with one or more prognostic variables stepped implicitly, the Jacobian matrix must be constructed and passed to the solver. All implicitly-stepped variables of the model should be added to the `implicit_names` tuple, and any explicitly-stepped variables should be added to the `explicit_names` tuple.
