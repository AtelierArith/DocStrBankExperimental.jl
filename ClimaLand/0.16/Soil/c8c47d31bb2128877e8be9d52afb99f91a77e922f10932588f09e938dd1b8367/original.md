Computes the derivative of the flux in the top layer (due to the boundary condition), with respect to the state variable in the top layer. This value is then updated in-place in the cache.

For Richards equation (a diffusion equation with a single state variable), this is given by `∂F_bc/∂Y_N= -K_N (∂ψ_bc/∂ϑ_N) / Δz`, where `N` indicates the top layer cell index and `ψ_bc` is the pressure head at the boundary condition.
