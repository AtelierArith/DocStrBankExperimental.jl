Adjusts dY.soil.ϑ_l in place to account for the loss of water due to subsurface runoff.

The sink term is given by - R*ss/h∇ H(twc - ν), where H is the Heaviside function, h∇ is the water table thickness (defined to be where twc>ν), where twc is the total water content,  and R*ss is the runoff as a flux(m/s).
