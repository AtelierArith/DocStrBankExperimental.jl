auxiliary_vars(model::PlantHydraulicsModel)
```

A function which returns the names of the auxiliary variables of the `PlantHydraulicsModel`, the transpiration stress factor `β` (unitless), the water potential `ψ` (m), the volume flux*cross section `fa` (1/s), and the volume flux*root cross section in the roots `fa_roots` (1/s), where the cross section can be represented by an area index.
