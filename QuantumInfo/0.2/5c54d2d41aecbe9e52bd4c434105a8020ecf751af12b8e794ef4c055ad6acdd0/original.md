`ketbra`

Returns the outer product between a dual vector (row vector) and a vector, each corresponding to a particular basis unit vector in some Hilbert space. This can also be interpreted as a matrix unite element specified by two unit vectors for a row and a column.

See `ket` for details on how the corresponding vectors may be specified.
