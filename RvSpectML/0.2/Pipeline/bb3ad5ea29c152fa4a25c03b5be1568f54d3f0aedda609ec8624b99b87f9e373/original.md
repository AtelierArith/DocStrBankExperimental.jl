prepare*line*list( linelist*fn, all*spectra, pipeline; recalc, convert*air*to*vacuum, orders*to*use, Î”v*to*avoid*tellurics, v*center*to*avoid*tellurics ) linelist*fn is the full path to the line list file linelist*fn is loaded as a VALD mask if it contains substring "VALD", and linelist*fn is loaded as an ESPRESSO mask if it contains the substring "espresso.mas". convert*air*to*vacuum is a boolean (defualt value true) that determines whether to convert to vaccum wavelengths when loading VALD and ESPRESSO masks.
