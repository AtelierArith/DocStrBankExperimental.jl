LightSource
```

Class that describes light source which is used to interact with the quantum two-level system.

# Fields

  * `wavelength` :   Represents a value of the main light source wavelength   (m).
  * `rabi_freq_1` :   Represents a value of the Rabi frequency originated from the interaction between   direct light beam and two-level system   (units of spontaneous emission frequency `γ₀`).
  * `rabi_freq_2` :   Represents a value of the Rabi frequency originated from the interaction between   reverse/reflected light beam and two-level system   (units of spontaneous emission frequency `γ₀`).

# Arguments

Refer to fields' description.

# Returns

  * `Laser` :   composite type instance.
