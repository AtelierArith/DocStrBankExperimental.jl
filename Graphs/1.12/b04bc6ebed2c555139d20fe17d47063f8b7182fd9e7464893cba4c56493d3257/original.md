```
is_tree(g)
```

Returns true if g is a tree:Â that is, a simple, connected undirected graph, with nv-1 edges (nv = number of vertices). Trees are the minimal connected graphs; equivalently they have no cycles.  

This function does not apply to directed graphs. Directed trees are sometimes called [polytrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytree)).
