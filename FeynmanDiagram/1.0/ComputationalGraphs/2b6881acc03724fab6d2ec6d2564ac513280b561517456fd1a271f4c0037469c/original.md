```
function has_zero_subfactors(g::AbstractGraph, operator_type::Type{<:AbstractOperator})

Determines whether the graph `g` has only zero-valued subgraph factors based on the specified operator type.
This function does not recurse through the subgraphs of `g`, so it only checks the immediate subgraph factors.
If `g` is a leaf (i.e., has no subgraphs), the function returns `false` by convention.

The behavior of the function depends on the operator type:
- `Sum`: Checks if all subgraph factors are zero.
- `Prod`: Checks if any subgraph factor is zero.
- `Power{N}`: Checks if the first subgraph factor is zero.
- Other `AbstractOperator`: Defaults to return `false`.
```

# Arguments:

  * `g::AbstractGraph`: graph to be analyzed
  * `operator`: the operator used in graph `g`
