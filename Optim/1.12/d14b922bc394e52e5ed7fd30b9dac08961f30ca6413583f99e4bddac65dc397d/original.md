# Optim.jl

Welcome to Optim.jl!

Optim.jl is a package used to solve continuous optimization problems. It is written in Julia for Julians to help take advantage of arbitrary number types, fast computation, and excellent automatic differentiation tools.

## REPL help

`?` followed by an algorithm name (`?BFGS`), constructors (`?Optim.Options`) prints help to the terminal.

## Documentation

Besides the help provided at the REPL, it is possible to find help and general documentation online at http://julianlsolvers.github.io/Optim.jl/stable/ .
