N x n matrices with orthonormal columns, i.e. such that X'X = I. Special cases: N x 1 = sphere, N x N = orthogonal/unitary group. Stiefel() uses a SVD algorithm to compute the retraction. To use a Cholesky-based orthogonalization (faster but less stable), use Stiefel(:CholQR). When the function to be optimized depends only on the subspace X*X' spanned by a point X in the Stiefel manifold, first-order optimization algorithms are equivalent for the Stiefel and Grassmann manifold, so there is no separate Grassmann manifold.
