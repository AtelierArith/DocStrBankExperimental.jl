```
branin(x; a=1, b=5.1/(4π^2), c=5/π, r=6, s=10, t=1/(8π))
```

The **Branin** (a.k.a. Branin-Hoo) function has six optional parameters, and features multiple global minima. Some of them are at $x^* = [-\pi, 12.275]$, $x^* = [\pi, 2.275]$, $x^* = [3\pi, 2.475]$ and $x^* = [5\pi, 12.875]$, with $f(x^*) \approx 0.397887$.

$$
f(x) = a(x_2 - bx_1^2 + cx_1 - r)^2 + s(1 - t)\cos(x_1) + s
$$
