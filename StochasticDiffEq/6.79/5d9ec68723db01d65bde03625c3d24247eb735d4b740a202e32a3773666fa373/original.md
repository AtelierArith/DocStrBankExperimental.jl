ImplicitRKMil: Stiff Method An order 1.0 drift-implicit method. This is a theta method which defaults to theta=1 or the Trapezoid method on the drift term. Defaults to solving the Ito problem, but ImplicitRKMil(interpretation=SciMLBase.AlgorithmInterpretation.Stratonovich) makes it solve the Stratonovich problem. This method defaults to symplectic=false, but when true and theta=1/2 this is the implicit Midpoint method on the drift term and is symplectic in distribution. Handles diagonal and scalar noise. Uses a 1.5/2.0 heuristic for adaptive time stepping.
