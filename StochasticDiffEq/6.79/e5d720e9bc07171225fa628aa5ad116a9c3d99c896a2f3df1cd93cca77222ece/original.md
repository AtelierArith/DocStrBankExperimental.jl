ISSEM: Stiff Method An order 0.5 split-step Ito implicit method. It is fully implicit, meaning it can handle stiffness in the noise term. This is a theta method which defaults to theta=1 or the Trapezoid method on the drift term. This method defaults to symplectic=false, but when true and theta=1/2 this is the implicit Midpoint method on the drift term and is symplectic in distribution. Can handle all forms of noise, including non-diagonal, scalar, and colored noise. Uses a 1.0/1.5 heuristic for adaptive time stepping.
