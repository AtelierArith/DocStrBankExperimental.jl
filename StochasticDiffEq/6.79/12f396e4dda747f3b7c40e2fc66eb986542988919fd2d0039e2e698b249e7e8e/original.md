LambaEM: Nonstiff Method A modified Euler-Maruyama method with adaptive time stepping with an error estimator based on Lamba and Rackauckas. Has an optional argument split=true for controlling step splitting. When splitting is enabled, the stability with large diffusion eigenvalues is improved. Strong Order 0.5 in the Ito sense. Can handle all forms of noise, including non-diagonal, scalar, and colored noise
