```
toktok_tokenize(instring::AstractString)
```

This tokenizer is a simple, general tokenizer, where the input has one sentence per line; thus only final period is tokenized. This is an enhanced version of the [original toktok Tokenizer](https://github.com/jonsafari/tok-tok) It has been tested on and gives reasonably good results for English, Persian, Russian, Czech, French, German, Vietnamese, Tajik, and a few others.
