Take advantage of the very special structure of automorphism generators given by nauty to efficiently enumerate the automorphism group. The generators are all given by disjoint swaps (and therefore are of order 2). We expand our automorphism group with each generator, which comes with a number "index" saying by what factor it increases the group. So if after gₙ we have an automorphism group of size N, then if gₙ₊₁ has an index of 3, then we will have fully incorporated the new generator when our group is of size 3*N. Moreover, there are just three new elements which start with gₙ₊₁ that we need to find, which we compose with our earlier group to get the new group. Our while loop explores the possible words that we can build (starting with gₙ₊₁)
