ConstrainedUncertainScalarPopulation(values, probs)
ConstrainedUncertainScalarPopulation(values, probs::Vector{Number})
ConstrainedUncertainScalarPopulation(values, probs::Statsbase.AbstractWeights)
```

A `ConstrainedUncertainScalarPopulation`, which consists of some population  members (`values`)and some weights (`probs`) that indicate the relative importance of  the population members (for example during resampling). The uncertain values  for this type is meant to consist of constrained uncertain values  (generated by calling `constrain(uval, sampling_constraint`) on them.

This is just a convenience type to indicate that the population has been  constrained. It behaves identically to `UncertainScalarPopulation`.

There are different constructors for different types of `values`:

  * If `values` contains only scalar numeric values, then the `values` field    will be of type `Vector{Number}`.
  * If `values` contains one or more uncertain values, then the `values` field    will be of type `Vector{AbstractUncertainValue}`
