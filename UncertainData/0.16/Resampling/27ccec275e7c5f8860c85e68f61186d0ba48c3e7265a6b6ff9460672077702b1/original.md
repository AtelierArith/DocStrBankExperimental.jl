```
resample(x::UVAL_COLLECTION_TYPES, constraint::Vector{<:SamplingConstraint}) -> Vector{T} where T
```

Resample `x` (a collection of uncertain values) once, applying the provided sampling `constraint`s. The number of constraints must match the number of elements in `x`.

Returns a `length(x)`-element vector. The `i`-th element of this vector is generated by  truncating the `i`-th uncertain value by the `i`-th sampling `constraint`, then drawing a single random  number from the truncated value. 

See also [`UVAL_COLLECTION_TYPES`](@ref).

## Example

```julia
# Generate some uncertain values where the `i`-th value is given by a normal 
# distribution with mean `i` and a standard deviation drawn from a uniform 
# distribution on `[0, 1]`.
uvals = [UncertainValue(Normal(i, rand())) for i = 1:100]

# Truncate each distribution at +- 0.5 standard deviations, then resample. 
resample(uvals, TruncateStd(0.5))
```
