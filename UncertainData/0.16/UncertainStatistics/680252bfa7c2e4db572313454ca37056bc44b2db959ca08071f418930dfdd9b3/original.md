```
OneSampleADTestElementWise(ud::UncertainDataset, d::UnivariateDistribution,
    n::Int = 1000)) -> Vector{OneSampleADTest}
```

First, draw `n` realisations of each uncertain value in `ud`, keeping one pool of values for each uncertain value. Then, perform an element-wise (pool-wise) one-sample Andersonâ€“Darling test of the null hypothesis that each value pool comes from the distribution `d` against the alternative hypothesis that the sample is not drawn from `d`.
