```
OneSampleADTestPooled(ud::UncertainDataset, d::UnivariateDistribution,
    n::Int = 1000)) -> OneSampleADTest
```

First, draw `n` realisations of each uncertain value in `ud` and pool them together. Then perform a one-sample Andersonâ€“Darling test of the null hypothesis that the pooled values comes from the distribution `d` against the alternative hypothesis that the sample is not drawn from `d`.
