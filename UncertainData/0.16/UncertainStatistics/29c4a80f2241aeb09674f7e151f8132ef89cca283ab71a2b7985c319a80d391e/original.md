EqualVarianceTTestPooled(d1::UncertainDataset, d2::UncertainDataset,
    n::Int = 1000; Î¼0::Real = 0) -> EqualVarianceTTest
```

Consider two samples `s1[i]` and `s2[i]`, each consisting of `n` random draws from the distributions furnishing the uncertain values `d1[i]` and `d2[i]`, respectively. Gather all `s1[i]` in a pooled sample `S1`, and all `s2[i]` in a pooled sample `S2`.

Perform a two-sample t-test of the null hypothesis that `S1` and `S2` come from distributions with equal means and variances against the alternative hypothesis that the distributions have different means but equal variances.
