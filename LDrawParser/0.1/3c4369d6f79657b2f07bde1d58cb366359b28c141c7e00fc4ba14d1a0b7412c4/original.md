```
parse_ldraw_file(filename)
parse_ldraw_file(filename; sneaky_parts::Set{String}=preprocess_ldraw_file(filename),
ignore_rotation_determinant::Bool=false)
```

Parse an LDraw file and return an MPDModel. Files can be .mpd or .ldr files.

# Keyword Arguments:

  * `sneaky_parts::Set{String}`: A set of part names that are masquerading as submodels.

Often not needed to include this argument, as it is automatically generated by `preprocess_ldraw_file`. (default: `preprocess_ldraw_file(filename)`)

  * `ignore_rotation_determinant::Bool`: If true, ignore the determinant of the

rotation matrix. Some parts have rotation matrices with negative determinants. This does not affect rendering, but can cause issues with other operations. (default: false)
