```
along_track_distance(pos₁::Point, pos₂::Point, pos₃::Point[,radius::Float64=Rₑ_m])
```

The `along_track_distance` from the start point `pos₁` [deg] to the closest point on the great circle path (defined by points `pos₁` and `pos₂` [deg]) to the point `pos₃` [deg]. Optionally a different `radius` for the earth can be used.
