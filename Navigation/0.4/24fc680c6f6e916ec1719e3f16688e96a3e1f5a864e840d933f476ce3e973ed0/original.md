Calculate distances, angles, speeds and points for aviation navigation purposes.

All angles are in degrees, distances are standard in meters, and speeds are standard in m/s.

These methods are not to be used for operational purposes.

Implemented Functions:

  * distance
  * angular_distance
  * bearing
  * final_bearing
  * midpoint
  * intermediate_point
  * destination_point
  * intersection_point
  * along*track*distance
  * cross*track*distance
  * Vground
  * head_wind
  * cross_wind
  * normalize
  * closest*point*to_pole
  * isinside

Implemented Types:

  * Point(ϕ, λ)
  * Airspace

Implemented constants:

  * Rₑ_m    Radius Earth in [m]
