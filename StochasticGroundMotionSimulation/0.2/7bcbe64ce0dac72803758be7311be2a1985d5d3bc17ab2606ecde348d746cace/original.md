fourier_constant(src::SourceParameters)
```

Define the constant source term for the Fourier Amplitude Spectrum. The value provided corresponds to Fourier displacement units of cm-s. Constant set to permit distances to be passed in km, densities in t/m^3, and velocities in km/s. The reference distance is set to 1.0 km (and interpreted to be a rupture distance).
