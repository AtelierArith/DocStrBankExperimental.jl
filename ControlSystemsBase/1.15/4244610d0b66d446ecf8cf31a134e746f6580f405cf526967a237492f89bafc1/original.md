Segments of the curve generated by this program is the boundary of the stability region for a process with transfer function P(s) The provided derivative gain is expected on parallel form, i.e., the form kp + ki/s + kd s, but the result can be transformed to any form given by the `form` keyword. The curve is found by analyzing

$$
P(s)C(s) = -1 ⟹ \\
|PC| = |P| |C| = 1 \\
arg(P) + arg(C) = -π
$$

If `P` is a function (e.g. s -> exp(-sqrt(s)) ), the stability of feedback loops using PI-controllers can be analyzed for processes with models with arbitrary analytic functions See also [`loopshapingPI`](@ref), [`loopshapingPID`](@ref), [`pidplots`](@ref)
