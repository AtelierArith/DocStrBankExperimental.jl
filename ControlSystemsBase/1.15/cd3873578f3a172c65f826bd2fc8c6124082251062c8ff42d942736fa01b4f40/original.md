`F(s)`, `F(omega, true)`, `F(z, false)`

Notation for frequency response evaluation.

  * F(s) evaluates the continuous-time transfer function F at s.
  * F(omega,true) evaluates the discrete-time transfer function F at exp(im*Ts*omega)
  * F(z,false) evaluates the discrete-time transfer function F at z
