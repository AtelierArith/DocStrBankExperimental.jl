```
Create an array of the colatitude in radians (theta) of each ring index in `rings` for a map with resolution `res`.

If no `rings` array is passed, the computation is performed on all the rings deducted from `res`.

If an integer `ring` is passed, a single Float value of the colatitude is returned.
