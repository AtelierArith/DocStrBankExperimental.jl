Census data set for the US population, drawn from R's package `survival`. RateTable `survexp_usr` gives the United States population, by age, sex and race, 1940 to 2014. Race is white or black. For 1960 and 1970 the black population values were not reported separately, so the nonwhite values were used. (Over the years, the reported tables have differed wrt reporting non-white and/or black.). Segmented by `sex ∈ (:male, :female)` and `race`∈ (:white, :black)`.
