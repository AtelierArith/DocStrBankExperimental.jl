```
basis, transformation = gröbner_transformation(polynomials)
```

Return a Gröbner basis for the ideal generated by `polynomials`, together with a `transformation` that proves that each element in `basis` is in that ideal (i.e. `basis == transformation * polynomials`).

This is computed using the GWV algorithm with a few standard optmizations; see [`PolynomialRings.GröbnerGWV.gwv`](@ref) for details.
