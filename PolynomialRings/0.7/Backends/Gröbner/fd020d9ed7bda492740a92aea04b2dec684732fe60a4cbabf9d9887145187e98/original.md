```
factors = lift(polynomials, y)
```

Return a row vector of `factors` such that `factors * polynomials` is equal to `y`, or `nothing` if `y` is not in the ideal generated by `polynomials`.

This is computed using `gröbner_transformation`; see there for more information.

Note: if you need to compute many lifts for the same set of `polynomials`, it is beneficial to use `gröbner_transformation` yourself as it avoids re-doing the most computationally intensive part.
