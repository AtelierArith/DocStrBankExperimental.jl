```
@polynomial x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1
```

Create a multi-variate polynomial from an expression by creating the ring generated by all symbols appearing in the expression.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> using PolynomialRings

julia> @polynomial x^3 + x^2*y + x*y^2 + y^3
x^3 + x^2*y + x*y^2 + y^3

julia> @polynomial x^3 + x^2*y + x*y^2 + y^3
x^3 + x^2*y + x*y^2 + y^3
```

!!! note
    In general, you cannot use variables from outside the macro expression; all symbols are interpreted as variables. For example:

    ```
    d = 4
    @polynomial d*x
    ```

    will give a polynomial in two variables, `d` and `x`.

    As a special exception, exponents are not interpreted, so

    ```
    @polynomial(x^d) == @polynomial(x)^d
    ```

    Unfortunately/confusingly, together, this gives

    ```
    @polynomial(d*x^(d-1))
    ```

    will have `d-1` interpreting `d` as an outer variable, and `d*x` is a monomial.

    This behaviour may (should?) change.
