NetworkLearning implements a generic framework for network classification. It could in theory be used for other functionality such as regression and density estimation, provided that appropriate methods for relational learning (i.e. relational variable generation) and collective inference are added. The framework is designed to make as little assumptions as possible on the elements involved in the process.
