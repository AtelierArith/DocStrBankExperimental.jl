```
exogenous_input_names(sys)
```

Return the names of each exogenous input of the process element `sys`.

# Extended Help

# Implementation

This function defaults to output the names assigned to each exogenous input connector. It is recomended to set these names to the names that should be output here and this function should only be overridden in special cases.
