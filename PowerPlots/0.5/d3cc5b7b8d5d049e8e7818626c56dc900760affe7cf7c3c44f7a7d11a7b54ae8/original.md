Using the Spring-Electric model suggested by Yifan Hu (http://yifanhu.net/PUB/graph*draw*small.pdf) Forces are calculated as :         f*attr(i,j) = ||xi - xj||^2 / K ,     i<->j         f*repln(i,j) = -CK^2 / ||xi - xj|| ,  i!=j Arguments :   adj_matrix      Sparse/Full Adjacency matrix of the graph   tol             Tolerance distance - Minimum distance between 2 nodes   C, K            Constants that help scale the layout Output :   positions       Co-ordinates for the nodes
