The [Generalised Gamma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_gamma_distribution) (GG) distribution is a three-parameter distribution with support on ${\mathbb R}_+$. The corresponding hazard function can accommodate bathtub, unimodal and monotone (increasing and decreasing) hazard shapes. The GG distribution has become popular in survival analysis due to its flexibility.
