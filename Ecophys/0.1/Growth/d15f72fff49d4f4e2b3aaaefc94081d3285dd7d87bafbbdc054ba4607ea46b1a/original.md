Data structure to store all parameters for the growth model of a plant organ.

# Arguments

  * `f`: fraction of dry matter allocated to different carbon pools of newly formed material, [carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, lignin, organic acids, minerals]

  * `tm`: time at which growth rate is maximum, [DD]
  * `tb`: base temperature, [Â°C]
  * `wmax`: maximum weight, [g]
