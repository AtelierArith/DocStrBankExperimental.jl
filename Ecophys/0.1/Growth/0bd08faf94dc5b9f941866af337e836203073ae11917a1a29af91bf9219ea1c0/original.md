Compute potential growth rate of the leaf according to thermal time (Yin et al 2003) The potential growth rate is computed as a function of thermal time (tt, DD), and the parameters of the growth model:     - time at which growth rate extinguishes (te, DD),     - time at which growth rate is maximum (tm, DD)     - base thermal time at which growth starts (tb, DD)     - maximum weight (wmax, g)
