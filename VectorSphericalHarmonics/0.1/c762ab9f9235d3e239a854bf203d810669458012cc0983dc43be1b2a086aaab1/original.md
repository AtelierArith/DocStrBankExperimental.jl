Vector spherical harmonics that are eigenfunctions of irreducible representationa of total, orbital as well as spin angular momenta. They may be constructed by coupling scalar spherical harmonics $Y_{L m}\left(\hat{n}\right)$ with the spherical basis vectors $\chi_\mu$ as

$$
\mathbf{Y}_{J M}^L\left(\hat{n}\right) = \sum_{m \mu} C^{J M}_{L m 1 \mu} Y_{L m}\left(\hat{n}\right) \chi_\mu,
$$
