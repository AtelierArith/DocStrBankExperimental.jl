The setup data received when the connection has been established. The struct has the following fields:

  * `protocol_major_version` – the major version number of the X protocol supported by the server (11)
  * `protocol_minor_version` – the minor version number of the X protocol supported by the server (0)
  * `release_number`
  * `resource_id_base`
  * `resource_id_mask` – XIDs are generated by selecting some submask of `resource_id_mask` and ORing it with `resource_id_base`
  * `motion_buffer_size` – approximately the number of pointer movement events that can be buffered
  * `maximum_request_length` – see the [`get_maximum_request_length`](@ref) docs
  * `image_byte_order` – the byte order of images the server expects (one of `XCB_IMAGE_ORDER_LSB_FIRST`, `XCB_IMAGE_ORDER_MSB_FIRST`)
  * `bitmap_format_bit_order` – bitmap bit order (`0` for LeastSignificant, `1` for MostSignificant)
  * `bitmap_format_scanline_unit`
  * `bitmap_format_scanline_pad`
  * `min_keycode` – the smallest keycode values transmitted by the server. Never less than 8
  * `max_keycode` – the largest keycode values transmitted by the server. Never greater than 255
  * `vendor` – the vendor of the X server
  * `screens` – see [`XCBScreen`](@ref)
  * `pixmap_formats` – see [`XCBFormat`](@ref)
