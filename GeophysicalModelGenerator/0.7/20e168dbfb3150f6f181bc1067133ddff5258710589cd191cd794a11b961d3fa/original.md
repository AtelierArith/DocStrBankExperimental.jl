LinearWeightedTemperature
```

Structure that defined a linear average temperature between two temperature fields as a function of distance

# Parameters

  * w_min:        Minimum weight
  * w_max:        Maximum weight
  * crit_dist:    Critical distance
  * dir:          Direction of the averaging (`:X`, `:Y` or `:Z`)
  * F1:           First temperature field
  * F2:           Second temperature field
