```

Thermal structure by McKenzie for a subducted slab that is fully embedded in the mantle.

# Parameters

  * `Tsurface`:     Top T [C]
  * `Tmantle`:      Bottom T [C]
  * `Adiabat`:      Adiabatic gradient in K/km
  * `v_cm_yr`:      Subduction velocity [cm/yr]
  * `Îº`:            Thermal diffusivity [m2/s]
  * `it`:           Number iterations employed in the harmonic summation
