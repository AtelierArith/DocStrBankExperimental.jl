The full path of the npm command is typically `/usr/local/bin/npm` on macOS and Linux, and `C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm` on Windows, but it can vary based on your installation. You can find the exact path by running the command `which npm` on macOS/Linux or `where npm` on Windows in your terminal or command prompt.
