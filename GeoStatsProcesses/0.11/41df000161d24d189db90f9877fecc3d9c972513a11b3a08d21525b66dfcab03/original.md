PoissonProcess(λ)
```

A Poisson process with intensity `λ`. For a homogeneous process, define `λ` as a constant real value, while for an inhomogeneous process, define `λ` as a function or vector of values. If `λ` is a vector, it is assumed that the process is associated with a `Domain` with the same number of elements as `λ`.
