```
billiard_raysplitting_showcase(x=2.0, y=1.0, r1=0.3, r2=0.2) -> bd, rayspl
```

Showcase example billiard for ray-splitting processes. A rectangle `(x,y)` with a SplitterWall at `x/2` and two disks at each side, with respective radii `r1`, `r2`.

**Notice**: This function returns a billiard `bd` as well as a `rayspl` dictionary!
