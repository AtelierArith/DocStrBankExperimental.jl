Module containing many functions helpful in simulating (perfect) mushroom billiards, see [`billiard_mushroom`](@ref). Contains stuff like initializing efficiently regular or chaotic particles and functions that return the corresponding chaotic or regular phase-space volumes or portions. The functions `V_3D_tot` and `V_3D_reg` use equations derived in ref. [1].
