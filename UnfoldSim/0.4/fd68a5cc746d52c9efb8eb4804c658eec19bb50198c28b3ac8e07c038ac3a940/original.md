```
PuRF(; n = 10.1, tmax = 0.93, sfreq = 100)
```

Default generator for PuRF Pupil Response Function. The canonical PRF is a gamma function and implemented according to Denison 2020 equation (2) going back to Hoeks & Levelt, 1993.

The pupil response is evaluated at t = 0:1/sfreq:3*tmax. The response is normalized by the peak-maximum at tmax, thus typically a pupil-response of 1 is returned (disregarding numerical issues).

# Keyword arguments:

  * `n = 10.1`: shape parameter
  * `tmax = 0.93`: peak maximum
  * `sfreq = 100`: sampling frequency

# Returns

  * `Vector`: canonical pupil response with length(0:1/sfreq:3*tmax) entries.

# Examples
