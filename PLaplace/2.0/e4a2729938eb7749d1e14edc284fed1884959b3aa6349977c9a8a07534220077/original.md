```julia
mutable struct AlgorithmLogData
```

Stores data read from an algorithm log file. Can be used to generate plots from one solution process. 

# Fields

  * `totalIterations::Vector{Union{Missing, Int64}}`: Running number of total iterations for each iteration.
  * `sections::Vector{String}`: Section tag in each iteration.
  * `partIterations::Vector{Union{Missing, Int64}}`: Running number of iterations in current section for each iteration.
  * `types::Vector{Union{Missing, String}}`: Tag for type of the update step for each iteration.         Only relevant for long and adaptive stepping schemes.
  * `lastaccepts::Vector{Union{Missing, Int64}}`: Number of iterations since previous accept for each iteration         Only relevant for adaptive stepping scheme.
  * `kappas::Vector{Union{Missing, Float64}}`: Parameter kappa for each iteration. Only relevant for adaptive stepping scheme.
  * `accnorms::Vector{Union{Missing, Float64}}`: Norm value for acceptance of step for each iteration.         Only relevant for long and adaptive stepping schemes.
  * `searchIterations::Vector{Union{Missing, Int64}}`: Number of iterations in backtracking linesearch for each iteration.         Only relevant for long and adaptive stepping schemes
  * `scalings::Vector{Union{Missing, Float64}}`: Scaling of the update generated by the backtracking for each iteration.         Only relevant for long and adaptive stepping schemes.
