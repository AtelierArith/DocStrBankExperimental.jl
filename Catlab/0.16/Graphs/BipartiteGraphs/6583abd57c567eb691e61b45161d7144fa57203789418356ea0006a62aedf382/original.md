Bipartite graphs, directed and undirected, as C-sets.

A graph theorist might call these "bipartitioned graphs," as in a graph *equipped with* a bipartition, as opposed to "bipartite graphs," as in a graph that *can be* bipartitioned. Here we use the former notion, which is more natural from the structuralist perspective, but the latter terminology, which is shorter and more familiar.
