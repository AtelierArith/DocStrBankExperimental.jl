Graph with properties.

"Property graphs" are graphs with arbitrary named properties on the graph, vertices, and edges. They are intended for applications with a large number of ad-hoc properties. If you have a small number of known properties, it is better and more efficient to create a specialized C-set type using `@acset_type`.
