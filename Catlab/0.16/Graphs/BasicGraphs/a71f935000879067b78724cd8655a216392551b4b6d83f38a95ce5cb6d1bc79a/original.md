Data structures for graphs, based on C-sets.

This module provides the category theorist's four basic kinds of graphs: graphs (aka directed multigraphs), symmetric graphs, reflexive graphs, and symmetric reflexive graphs. It also defines half-edge graphs, which are isomorphic to symmetric graphs, and a few standard kinds of attributed graphs, such as weighted graphs.

The graphs API generally follows that of [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl), with some departures due to differences between the data structures.
