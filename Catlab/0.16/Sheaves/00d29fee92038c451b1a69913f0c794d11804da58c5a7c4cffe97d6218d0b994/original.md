```
extend(X::Sheaf{T, FVectPullback}, cover::ColimCover, sections::Vector{Vector{R}}; check=true, debug=false) where {T<:DiagramTopology, R}
```

This method implements the extension operation for the diagram topology on FinSet for the Free Vector Space functor. The implementation does copies the value of the ith section into the jth spot as indicated by the legs of the cocone.
