Operadic composition of wiring diagrams.

This generic function has two different signatures, corresponding to the "full" and "partial" notions of operadic composition (Yau, 2018, *Operads of Wiring Diagrams*, Definitions 2.3 and 2.10).

This operation is a simple wrapper around [`substitute`](@ref).
