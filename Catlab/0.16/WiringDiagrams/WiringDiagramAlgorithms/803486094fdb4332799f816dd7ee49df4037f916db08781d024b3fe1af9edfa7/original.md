Normalize copies in a wiring diagram.

This function maximizes sharing of intermediate computations in a wiring diagram where copies are natural.

This algorithm is basically the same as the congruence closure algorithm on term graphs, in the special case of the empty relation R = âˆ… (Baader & Nipkow, 1998, Term Rewriting and All That, Sec. 4.4). The main difference is the possibility of zero or many function outputs.
