Convert wiring diagrams to and from syntactic expressions.

Wiring diagrams are a graphical syntax for morphisms in a monoidal category. As mathematical objects, they are intermediate between the morphisms themselves and expressions in the textual syntax: a single morphism may correspond to many wiring diagrams, and a single wiring diagram may correspond to many syntactic expressions.

It is trivial to convert a morphism expression to a wiring diagram, but not to go the other way around.
