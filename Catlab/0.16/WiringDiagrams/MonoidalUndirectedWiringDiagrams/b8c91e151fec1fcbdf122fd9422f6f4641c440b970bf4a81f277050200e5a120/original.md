Act on undirected wiring diagram with a cospan, as in a cospan algebra.

A *cospan algebra* is a lax monoidal functor from a category of (typed) cospans (Cospan,⊕) to (Set,×) (Fong & Spivak, 2019, Hypergraph categories, §2.1: Cospans and cospan-algebras). Undirected wiring diagrams are a cospan algebra in essentially the same way that any hypergraph category is (Fong & Spivak, 2019, §4.1: Cospan-algebras and hypergraph categories are equivalent). In fact, we use this action to implement the hypergraph category structure, particularly composition, on undirected wiring diagrams.
