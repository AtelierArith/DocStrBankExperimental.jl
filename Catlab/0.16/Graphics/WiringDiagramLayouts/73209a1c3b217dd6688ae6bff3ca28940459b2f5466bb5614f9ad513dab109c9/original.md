Lay out a wiring diagram or morphism expression for visualization.

If a wiring diagram is given, it is first to converted to a morphism expression.

The layout is calculated with respect to a cartesian coordinate system with origin at the center of the diagram and the positive y-axis pointing *downwards*. Box positions are relative to their centers. All positions and sizes are dimensionless (unitless).
