Coerce or look up object in category.

Converts the input to an object in the category, which should be of type `Ob` in a category of type `Cat{Ob,Hom}`. How this works depends on the category, but a common case is to look up objects, which might be integers or GAT expressions, by their human-readable name, usually a symbol.
