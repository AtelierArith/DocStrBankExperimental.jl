Oppositization 2-functor.

The oppositization endo-2-functor on Cat, sending a category to its opposite, is covariant on objects and morphisms and contravariant on 2-morphisms, i.e., is a 2-functor $op: Catᶜᵒ → Cat$. For more explanation, see the [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/opposite+category).
