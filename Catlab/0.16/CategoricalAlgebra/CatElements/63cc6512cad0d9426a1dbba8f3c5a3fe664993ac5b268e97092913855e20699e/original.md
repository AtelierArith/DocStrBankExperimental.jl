```
inverse_elements(X::AbstractElements, typ::StructACSet)
```

Compute inverse grothendieck transformation on the result of `elements`. Does not assume that the elements are ordered. Rather than dynamically create a new ACSet type, it requires any instance of the ACSet type that it's going to try to create

If the typed graph tries to assert conflicting values for a foreign key, fail. If no value is specified for a foreign key, the result will have 0's.
