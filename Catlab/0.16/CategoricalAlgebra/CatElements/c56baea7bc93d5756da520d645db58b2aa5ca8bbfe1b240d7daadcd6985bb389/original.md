elements(X::AbstractACSet)
```

construct the category of elements from an ACSet. This only correctly handles the CSet part. This transformation converts an instance of C into a Graph homomorphism. The codomain of the homomorphism is a graph shaped like the schema. This is one half of the isomorphism between databases and knowledge graphs.
