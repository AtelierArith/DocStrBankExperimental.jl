Find attributed $C$-set homomorphisms using a conjunctive query.

This algorithm evaluates a conjunctive query (limit in `FinSet`) to find all homomorphisms between two $C$-sets. In fact, conjunctive queries are exactly the *representable* functors from $C$-sets to sets, so every conjunctive query arises in this way, with the caveat that conjunctive queries may correspond to to infinite $C$-sets when $C$ is infinite (but possibly finitely presented).
