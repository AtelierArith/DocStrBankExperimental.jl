Find attributed $C$-set homomorphisms using backtracking search.

This procedure uses the classic backtracking search algorithm for a combinatorial constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). As is well known, the homomorphism problem for relational databases is reducible to CSP. Since the C-set homomorphism problem is "the same" as the database homomorphism problem (insofar as attributed C-sets are "the same" as relational databases), it is also reducible to CSP. Backtracking search for CSP is described in many computer science textbooks, such as (Russell & Norvig 2010, *Artificial Intelligence*, Third Ed., Chapter 6: Constraint satisfaction problems, esp. Algorithm 6.5). In our implementation, the search tree is ordered using the popular heuristic of "minimum remaining values" (MRV), also known as "most constrained variable.
