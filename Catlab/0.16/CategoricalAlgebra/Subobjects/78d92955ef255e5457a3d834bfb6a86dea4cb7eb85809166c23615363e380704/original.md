Subobject in a category.

By definition, a subobject of an object $X$ in a category is a monomorphism into $X$. This is the default representation of a subobject. Certain categories may support additional representations. For example, if the category has a subobject classifier $Ω$, then subobjects of $X$ are also morphisms $X → Ω$.
