Category of (possibly infinite) sets and functions.

This module defines generic types for the category of sets ([`SetOb`](@ref), [`SetFunction`](@ref)), as well as a few basic concrete types, such as a wrapper type to view Julia types as sets ([`TypeSet`](@ref)). Extensive support for finite sets is provided by another module, [`FinSets`](@ref).
