Abstract type for object in the category **Set**.

The type parameter `T` is the element type of the set.

Note: This type is more abstract than the built-in Julia types `AbstractSet` and `Set`, which are intended for data structures for finite sets. Those are encompassed by the subtype [`FinSet`](@ref).
