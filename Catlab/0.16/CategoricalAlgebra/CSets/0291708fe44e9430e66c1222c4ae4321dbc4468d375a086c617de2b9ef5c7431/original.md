Returns a dictionary whose keys are contained in the names in `arrows(S)` and whose value at `:f`, for an arrow `(f,c,d)`, is a lazy iterator over the elements of X(c) on which Î±'s naturality square for f does not commute. Components should be a NamedTuple or Dictionary with keys contained in the names of S's morphisms and values vectors or dicts defining partial functions from X(c) to Y(c).
