Tight transformation between attributed C-sets.

The category of attributed C-sets and tight homomorphisms is isomorphic to a slice category of C-Set, as explained in our paper "Categorical Data Structures for Technical Computing". Colimits in this category thus reduce to colimits of C-sets, by a standard result about slice categories. Limits are more complicated and are currently not supported.

For the distinction between tight and loose, see [`ACSetTranformation`](@ref).
