Loose transformation between attributed C-sets.

Limits and colimits in the category of attributed C-sets and loose homomorphisms are computed pointwise on both objects *and* attribute types. This implies that (co)limits of Julia types must be computed. Due to limitations in the expressivity of Julia's type system, only certain simple kinds of (co)limits, such as products, are supported.

Alternatively, colimits involving loose acset transformations can be constructed with respect to explicitly given attribute type components for the legs of the cocone, via the keyword argument `type_components` to `colimit` and related functions. This uses the universal property of the colimit. To see how this works, notice that a diagram of acsets and loose acset transformations can be expressed as a diagram D: J → C-Set (for the C-sets) along with another diagram A: J → C-Set (for the attribute sets) and a natural transformation α: D ⇒ A (assigning attributes). Given a natural transformation τ: A ⇒ ΔB to a constant functor ΔB, with components given by `type_components`, the composite transformation α⋅τ: D ⇒ ΔB is a cocone under D, hence factors through the colimit cocone of D. This factoring yields an assigment of attributes to the colimit in C-Set.
