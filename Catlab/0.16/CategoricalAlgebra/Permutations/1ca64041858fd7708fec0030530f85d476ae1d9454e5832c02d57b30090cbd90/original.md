Decompose permutation into adjacent transpositions using bubble sort.

An *adjacent transposition*, also known as a *simple transposition*, is a transposition of form (i i+1), represented here as simply the number i.

This algorithm appears as Algorithm 2.7 in the PhD thesis of Jonathan Huang, "Probabilistic reasonsing and learning on permutations: Exploiting structural decompositions of the symmetric group". As Huang notes, the algorithm is very similar to the well-known bubble sort. It has quadratic complexity.
