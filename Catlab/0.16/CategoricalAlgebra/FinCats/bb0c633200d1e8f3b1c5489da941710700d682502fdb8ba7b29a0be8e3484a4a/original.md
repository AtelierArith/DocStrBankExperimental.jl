Dual to a [final functor](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/final+functor), an *initial functor* is one for which pulling back diagrams along it does not change the limits of these diagrams.

This amounts to checking, for a functor C->D, that, for every object d in Ob(D), the comma category (F/d) is connected.
