A natural transformation whose domain category is finitely generated.

This type is for natural transformations $α: F ⇒ G: C → D$ such that the domain category $C$ is finitely generated. Such a natural transformation is given by a finite amount of data (one morphism in $D$ for each generating object of $C$) and its naturality is verified by finitely many equations (one equation for each generating morphism of $C$).
