Reinterpret a functor on a finitely presented category as a functor on the equivalent category (ignoring equations) free on a graph. Also normalizes the input to have vector ob*map and hom*map, with valtype optionally specified. This is useful when the domain is empty or when the maps might be tightly typed but need to allow for types such as that of identity morphisms upon mutation.
