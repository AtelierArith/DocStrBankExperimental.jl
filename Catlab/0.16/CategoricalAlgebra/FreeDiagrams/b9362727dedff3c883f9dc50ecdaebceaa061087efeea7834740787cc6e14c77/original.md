Objects in diagram that will have explicit legs in limit cone.

In category theory, it is common practice to elide legs of limit cones that can be computed from other legs, especially for diagrams of certain fixed shapes. For example, when it taking a pullback (the limit of a cospan), the limit object is often treated as having two projections, rather than three. This function encodes such conventions by listing the objects in the diagram that will have corresponding legs in the limit object created by Catlab.
