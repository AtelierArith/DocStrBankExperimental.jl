A free diagram with a bipartite structure.

Such diagrams include most of the fixed shapes, such as spans, cospans, and parallel morphisms. They are also the generic shape of diagrams for limits and colimits arising from undirected wiring diagrams. For limits, the boxes correspond to vertices in $V₁$ and the junctions to vertices in $V₂$. Colimits are dual.
