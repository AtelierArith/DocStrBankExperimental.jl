Net present cost factors of some part of a Microgrid project

Cost factors can be evaluated to a *single component* or to a *set* of components like the entire microgrid system.

Cost factors are expressed as Net Present Values, meaning they represent *cumulated and discounted* sums over the lifetime the Microgrid project.
