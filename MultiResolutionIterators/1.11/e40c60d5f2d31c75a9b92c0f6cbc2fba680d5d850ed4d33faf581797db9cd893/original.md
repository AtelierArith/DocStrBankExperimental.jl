```
consolidate_levels(iter, levels)
```

Applies `consolidate` on the given levels. To turn those levels from iterators into something indexable. `consolidate` is basically `collect` but it doesn't return `Vectors` just something indexable

See also `full_consolidate`, which is an alias for doing this on all levels.
