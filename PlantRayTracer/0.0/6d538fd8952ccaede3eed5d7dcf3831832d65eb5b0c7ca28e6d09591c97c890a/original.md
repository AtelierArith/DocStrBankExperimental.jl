```
RayTracer(mesh, materials, sources, settings)
```

Create a ray tracer object from an acceleration structure built around a 3D mesh, a grid cloner structure around the acceleration structure (`mesh`), a vector of materials associated to the mesh (`materials`), a vector of sources of irradiance (`sources`) and settings. (as generated by `RTSettings()`). See VPL documentation for more details on the ray tracer.
