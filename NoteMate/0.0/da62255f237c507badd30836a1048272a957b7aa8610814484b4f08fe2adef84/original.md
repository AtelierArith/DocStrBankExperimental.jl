Struct representing a note in Zettelkasten

The generic Open Knowledge Model note with its key structures, isolated as single strings and some further metadata in appropiate  types. Within the constraints of NoteMate this is the generic type to which any note from any specific format parses down, and from  which other note structures for representation targets are build using templating functions.
