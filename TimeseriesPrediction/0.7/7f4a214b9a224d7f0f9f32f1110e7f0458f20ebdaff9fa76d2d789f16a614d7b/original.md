Symmetry
```

Supertype of all symmetries used in [`SymmetricEmbedding`](@ref). All symmetries are initialized like `Symmetry(n1, n2, ...)` with `ni` being the indices of the spatial dimensions that have the said symmetry.

Notice that the symmetries are defined with respect to the center point of the embedding.
