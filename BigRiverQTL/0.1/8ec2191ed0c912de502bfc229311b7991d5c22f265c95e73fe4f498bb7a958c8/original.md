```
get_control_file(filename::String) -> (String, String)
```

Locate the control file and determine the directory where it resides.

# Arguments

  * `filename::String`: A string representing either the path to a file or a directory.

# Returns

  * `(String, String)`: A tuple containing the directory of the control file and the path

to the control file. If the provided `filename` is a directory, the function will search  for JSON files within and return the path to the first JSON file found.

# Description

The function first resolves the absolute path of the provided `filename`. If `filename`  points to an existing file, the function identifies the directory containing this  file. If `filename` specifies a directory, the function lists all entries in this  directory, searches for the first JSON file, and updates `filename` to the path of this  JSON file.
