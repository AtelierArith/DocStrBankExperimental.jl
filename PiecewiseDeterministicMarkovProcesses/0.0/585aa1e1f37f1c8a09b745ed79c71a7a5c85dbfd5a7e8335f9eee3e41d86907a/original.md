This type stores the output composed of:

  * **time** : a `Vector` of `Float64`, containing the times of simulated events.
  * **xc** : containing the simulated states for the continuous variable.
  * **xd** : containing the simulated states for the continuous variable.
  * **rates** : containing the rates used during the simulation
