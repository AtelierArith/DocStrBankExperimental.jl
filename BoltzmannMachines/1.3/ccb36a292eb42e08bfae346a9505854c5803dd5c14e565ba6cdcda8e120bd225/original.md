```
computegradient!(optimizer, v, vmodel, h, hmodel, rbm)
```

Computes the gradient of the RBM `rbm` given the the hidden activation `h` induced by the sample `v` and the vectors `vmodel` and `hmodel` generated by sampling from the model. The result is stored in the `optimizer` in such a way that it can be applied by a call to `updateparameters!`. There is no return value.

For RBMs (excluding PartitionedRBMs), this means saving the gradient in a RBM of the same type in the field `optimizer.gradient`.
