Computes the mean empirical loglikelihood for the data set `x`. The probability of a sample is estimated to be the empirical probability of the sample in a dataset generated by the model. This data set can be given as `xgen` or it is generated by running a Gibbs sampler with `nparticles` for `burnin` steps (default 5) in the Boltzmann Machine `bm`. Throws an error if a sample in `x` is not contained in the generated data set.
