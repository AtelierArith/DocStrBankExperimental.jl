BernoulliRBM(weights, visbias, hidbias)
```

Encapsulates the parameters of an RBM with Bernoulli distributed nodes.

  * `weights`: matrix of weights with size (number of visible nodes, number of hidden nodes)
  * `visbias`: bias vector for visible nodes
  * `hidbias`: bias vector for hidden nodes
