```
bsdiff(old, new, [ patch ]; format = [ :classic | :endsley ]) -> patch
```

Compute a binary patch that will transform the content of `old` into the content of `new`. All arguments can be strings or IO handles. If no `patch` argument is provided, the patch data is written to a temporary file whose path is returned.

The `old` argument can also be a 2-tuple of strings and/or IO handles, in which case the first is used as the old data and the second is used as a precomputed index of the old data, as computed by [`bsindex`](@ref). Since indexing the old data is the slowest part of generating a diff, precomputing this and reusing it can significantly speed up generting diffs from the same old file to multiple different new files.

The `format` keyword argument allows selecting a patch format to generate. The value must be one of the symbols `:classic` or `:endsley` indicating a bsdiff patch format. The classic patch format is generated by default, but the Endsley format can be selected with `bsdiff(old, new, patch, format = :endsley)`.
