nonmaxsuppts - Non-maximal suppression for features/corners

Non maxima suppression and thresholding for points generated by a feature or corner detector.

```
Usage:   (r,c) = nonmaxsuppts(cimg; radius=1, thresh=0, N=Inf, subpix=false, img=[], fig=nothing)

Argument:
           cimg   - corner strength image. ::Array{T,2}

Keyword Arguments:
           radius - radius of region considered in non-maximal
                    suppression. Typical values to use might
                    be 1-3 pixels. Default (and minimum value) is 1.
           thresh - Threshold, only features with value greater than
                    threshold are returned. Default is 0.
                N - Maximum number of features to return.  In this case the
                    N strongest features with value above 'thresh' are
                    returned. Default is Inf.
         subpixel - If set to true features are localised to subpixel
                    precision. Default is false.
             img  - Optional image data.  If an image is supplied the
                    detected corners are overlayed on this image. This can
                    be useful for parameter tuning. Default is [].
              fig - Optional figure number to display image and corner points.
                    If not specified a new figure is generated.

Returns:
           r,c    - row and column coordinates of corner points.
```

Example of use:

```
 > hes = hessianfeatures(img, 1)   # Compute Hessian feature image in image img
```

Find the 1000 strongest features to subpixel precision using a non-maximal suppression radius of 2 and overlay the detected corners on the origin image.

```
 > (r,c) = nonmaxsuppts(abs(hes), radius=2, N=1000, img=img, subpixel=true)
```

Note: An issue with integer valued images is that if there are multiple pixels all with the same value within distance 2*radius of each other then they will all be marked as local maxima.
