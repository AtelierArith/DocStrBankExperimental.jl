fitfunddemo - Example of fundamental matrix computation

Demonstration of feature matching via simple correlation, and then using RANSAC to estimate the fundamental matrix and at the same time identify (mostly) inlying matches

```
Usage:  fitfunddemo           - Demonstrates fundamental matrix calculation
                                on two default images.
        funddemo(img1,img2)   - Computes fundamental matrix on two supplied
                                images.
```

Edit code as necessary to tweak parameters
