iscolinear - Are 3 points colinear

```
Usage:  r = iscolinear(p1, p2, p3, flag)

Arguments:
       p1, p2, p3 - Points in 2D or 3D.
       homog      - An optional boolean flag indicating that p1, p2, p3
                    are homogneeous coordinates with arbitrary scale.
                    The default is false, that is it is assumed that the
                    points are inhomogeneous, or that they are homogeneous
                    ewith qual scale.

Returns:
       r  -  true if points are co-linear, false otherwise
