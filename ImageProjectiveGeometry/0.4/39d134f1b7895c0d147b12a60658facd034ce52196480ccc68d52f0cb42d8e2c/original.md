fithomogdemo - Example of finding a homography

Demonstration of feature matching via simple correlation, and then using RANSAC to estimate the homography between two images and at the same time identify (mostly) inlying matches

```
Usage:  fithomogdemo            - Demonstrates homography calculation on two 
                                  default images
        fithomogdemo(img1,img2) - Computes homography on two supplied images

Edit code as necessary to tweak parameters
