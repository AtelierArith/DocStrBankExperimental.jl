```julia
biased_progressive_logprob2(bias, ω₁, ω₂)
biased_progressive_logprob2(bias, ω₁, ω₂, ω)

```

Given (relative) log probabilities `ω₁` and `ω₂`, return the log probabiliy of drawing a sample from the second (`logprob2`). When `bias`, biases towards the second argument, introducing anti-correlations.
