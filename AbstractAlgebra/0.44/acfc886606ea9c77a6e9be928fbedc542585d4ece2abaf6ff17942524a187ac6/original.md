```
hgcd(a::PolyRingElem{T}, b::PolyRingElem{T}) where T
```

Returns the half-GCD of `a` and `b`, that is, a tuple `(A, B, m11, m12, m21, m22, s::Int)` such that

1. m11*m22 - m12*m21 = s = +-1
2. m11*A + m12*B = a
3. m21*A + m22*B = b
4. `A` and `B` are consecutive remainders in the sequence for division of `a` by `b` satisfying `deg(A) >= cld(deg(a), 2) > deg(B)
5. `[m11 m12; m21 m22]` is the product of `[q 1; 1 0]` for the quotients `q` generated by such a remainder sequence.

Assumes that the input satsifies `degree(a) > degree(b) >= 0`.

Cutoffs are currently dictated by the non-exported functions `hgcd_prefers_basecase(a, b)` `mat22_mul_prefers_classical(a11, a12, a21, a22, b11, b12, b21, b22)`

If the base ring of the polynomial ring is not a field, this function may throw a NotInvertibleError. Otherwise, the output should be valid.
