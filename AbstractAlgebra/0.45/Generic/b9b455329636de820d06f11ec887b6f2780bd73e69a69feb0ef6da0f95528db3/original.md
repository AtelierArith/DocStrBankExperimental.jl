```
 localization(R::AbstractAlgebra.Ring, primes::Vector{T}; cached::Bool=true) where {T <: RingElement}
```

Returns the localization of the ring $R$ at the union of principal ideals that are generated by the ring elements in $primes$. Requires $R$ to be an euclidean domain and $primes$ to be prime elements, both not checked. If `cached == true` (the default) then the resulting localization parent object is cached and returned for any subsequent calls to the constructor with the same base ring $R$ and elements $primes$.
