```
localization(R::AbstractAlgebra.Ring, prime::T; cached::Bool=true, comp=false) where {T <: RingElement}
```

Returns the localization of the ring $R$ at the ideal generated by the ring element $prime$. Requires $R$ to be an euclidean domain and $prime$ to be a prime element, both not checked. If `cached == true` (the default) then the resulting localization parent object is cached and returned for any subsequent calls to the constructor with the same base ring $R$ and element $prime$.
