Creates the RatcliffObershelp distance

The distance between two strings is defined as one minus  the number of matching characters  divided by the total number of characters in the two strings. Matching characters are those  in the longest common subsequence plus, recursively, matching characters in the unmatched  region on either side of the longest common subsequence.
