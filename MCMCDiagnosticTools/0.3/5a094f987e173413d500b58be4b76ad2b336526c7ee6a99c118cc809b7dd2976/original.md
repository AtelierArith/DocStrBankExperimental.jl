Compute the Gelman, Rubin and Brooks diagnostics [^Gelman1992] [^Brooks1998] on `samples` with shape `(draws, chains, parameters)`.  Values of the diagnosticâ€™s potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) that are close to one suggest convergence.  As a rule-of-thumb, convergence is rejected if the 97.5 percentile of a PSRF is greater than 1.2.
