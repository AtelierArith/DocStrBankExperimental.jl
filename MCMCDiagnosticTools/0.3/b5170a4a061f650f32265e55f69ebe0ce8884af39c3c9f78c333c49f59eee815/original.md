```

Compute the $\widehat{R}$ diagnostics for each parameter in `samples` of shape `(draws, [chains[, parameters...]])`.[^VehtariGelman2021]

`kind` indicates the kind of $\widehat{R}$ to compute (see below).

`split_chains` indicates the number of chains each chain is split into. When `split_chains > 1`, then the diagnostics check for within-chain convergence. When `d = mod(draws, split_chains) > 0`, i.e. the chains cannot be evenly split, then 1 draw is discarded after each of the first `d` splits within each chain.

## Kinds of $\widehat{R}$

The following `kind`s are supported:

  * `:rank`: maximum of $\widehat{R}$ with `kind=:bulk` and `kind=:tail`.
  * `:bulk`: basic $\widehat{R}$ computed on rank-normalized draws. This kind diagnoses   poor convergence in the bulk of the distribution due to trends or different locations of   the chains.
  * `:tail`: $\widehat{R}$ computed on draws folded around the median and then   rank-normalized. This kind diagnoses poor convergence in the tails of the distribution   due to different scales of the chains.
  * `:basic`: Classic $\widehat{R}$.
