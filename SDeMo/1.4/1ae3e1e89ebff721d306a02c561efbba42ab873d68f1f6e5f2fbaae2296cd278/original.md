SDM
```

This type specifies a *full* model, which is composed of a transformer (which applies a transformation on the data), a classifier (which returns a quantitative score), a threshold (above which the score corresponds to the prediction of a presence).

In addition, the SDM carries with it the training features and labels, as well as a vector of indices indicating which variables are actually used by the model.
