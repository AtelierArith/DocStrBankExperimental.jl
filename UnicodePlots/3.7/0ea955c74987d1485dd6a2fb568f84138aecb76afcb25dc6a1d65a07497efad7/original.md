Similar to the `AsciiCanvas`, the `DotCanvas` only uses ASCII characters to draw its content. Naturally, it doesn't look quite as nice as the Unicode-based ones. However, in some situations it might yield better results. Printing plots to a file is one of those situations.

The DotCanvas is best used in combination with `scatterplot`. For `lineplot` we suggest to use the `AsciiCanvas` instead.
