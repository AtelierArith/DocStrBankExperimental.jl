As the name suggests the `AsciiCanvas` only uses ASCII characters to draw it's content. Naturally, it doesn't look quite as nice as the Unicode-based ones. However, in some situations it might yield better results. Printing plots to a file is one of those situations.

The AsciiCanvas is best utilized in combination with `lineplot`. For `scatterplot` we suggest to use the `DotCanvas` instead.
