A module containing low-level drawing commands via PGF.

# Conventions

PGF command names translate with the prefix, eg "pgfpathclose" is `PGF.pathclose`.

Each function takes an `IO` argument, where it writes the relevant output to it.

**Coordinates** should be subtypes of `Unitful.Length`, and will be converted internally.

# API

FIXME document it
