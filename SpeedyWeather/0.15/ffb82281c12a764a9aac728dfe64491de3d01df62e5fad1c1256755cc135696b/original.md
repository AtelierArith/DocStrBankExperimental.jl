```julia
initialize!(
    geopotential::SpeedyWeather.Geopotential,
    model::SpeedyWeather.PrimitiveEquation
)

```

Precomputes constants for the vertical integration of the geopotential, defined as

`Φ_{k+1/2} = Φ_{k+1} + R*T_{k+1}*(ln(p_{k+1}) - ln(p_{k+1/2}))` (half levels) `Φ_k = Φ_{k+1/2} + R*T_k*(ln(p_{k+1/2}) - ln(p_k))` (full levels)

Same formula but `k → k-1/2`.
