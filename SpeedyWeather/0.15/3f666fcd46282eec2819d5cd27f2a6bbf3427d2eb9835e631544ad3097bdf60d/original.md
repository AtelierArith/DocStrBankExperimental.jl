Zonal ridge orography after Jablonowski and Williamson, 2006.

  * `η₀::Any`: conversion from σ to Jablonowski's ηᵥ-coordinates
  * `u₀::Any`: max amplitude of zonal wind [m/s] that scales orography height
  * `orography::Any`: height [m] on grid-point space.
  * `geopot_surf::Any`: surface geopotential, height*gravity [m²/s²]
