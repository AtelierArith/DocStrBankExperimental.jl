Subtype of `AbstractGridArray` for arrays of rings grids that have a reduced number of longitude points towards the poles, i.e. they are not "full", see `AbstractFullGridArray`. Data on these grids cannot be represented as matrix and has to be unravelled into a vector, ordered 0 to 360ËšE then north to south, ring by ring. Examples for reduced grids are  the octahedral Gaussian or Clenshaw grids, or the HEALPix grid.
