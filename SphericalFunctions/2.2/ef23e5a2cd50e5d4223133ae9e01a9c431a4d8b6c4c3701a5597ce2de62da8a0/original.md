Compute Wigner's ùîá matrices $\mathfrak{D}^{(\ell)}_{m',m}(\beta)$ for all $\ell \leq \ell_\mathrm{max}$.

See [`D_matrices!`](@ref) for details about the input and output values.

This function only appropriate when you need to evaluate the matrices for a single value of `R` or `Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥` because it allocates large arrays and performs many calculations that could be reused.  If you need to evaluate the matrices for many values of `R` or `Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥`, you should pre-allocate the storage with [`D_prep`](@ref), and then call [`D_matrices!`](@ref) with the result instead.
