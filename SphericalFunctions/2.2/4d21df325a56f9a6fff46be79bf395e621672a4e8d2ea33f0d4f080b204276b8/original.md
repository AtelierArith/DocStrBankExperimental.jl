Compute Wigner's ùîá matrices $\mathfrak{D}^{(\ell)}_{m',m}(\beta)$ for all $\ell \leq \ell_\mathrm{max}$.

In all cases, the result is returned in a 1-dimensional array ordered as

```
[
    ùîáÀ°‚Çò‚Çö,‚Çò(R)
    for ‚Ñì ‚àà 0:‚Ñì‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì
    for mp ‚àà -‚Ñì:‚Ñì
    for m ‚àà -‚Ñì:‚Ñì
]
```

When the first argument is `D`, it will be modified, so it must be at least as large as that array. When the first argument is `D_storage`, it should be the quantity returned by [`D_prep`](@ref), and the result will be written into the `D` field of that tuple.  Both of these options ‚Äî especially the latter ‚Äî reduce the number of allocations needed on each call to the corresponding functions, which should increase the speed significantly.  Note that the `D` or `D_storage` arguments must have types compatible with the type of `R` or `Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥`.

!!! warn
    When using the `D_storage` argument (which is recommended), the returned quantity `D` will be an alias of `D_storage[1]`.  If you want to retain that data after the next call to [`D_matrices!`](@ref), you should copy it with `copy(D)`.


The `Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥` arguments are Euler angles as described in the documentation of [`Quaternionic.from_euler_angles`](https://moble.github.io/Quaternionic.jl/dev/manual/#Quaternionic.from_euler_angles-Tuple{Any,%20Any,%20Any}).

See also [`D_matrices`](@ref) for a simpler function call when you only need to evaluate the matrices for a single value of `R` or `Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥`.

# Examples

```julia
using Quaternionic, SphericalFunctions
‚Ñì‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì = 8
T = Float64
R = Rotor{T}(1, 2, 3, 4)  # Will be normalized automatically
D_storage = D_prep(‚Ñì‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì, T)
D = D_matrices!(D_storage, R)
```
