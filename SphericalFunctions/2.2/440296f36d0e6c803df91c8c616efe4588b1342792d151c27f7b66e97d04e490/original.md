golden_ratio_spiral_pixels(s, ℓₘₐₓ, [T=Float64])
```

Cover the sphere 𝕊² with pixels generated by the golden-ratio spiral. Successive pixels are separated by the azimuthal angle $Δϕ = 2π(2-φ)$, and are uniformly distributed in $\cos θ$.

This is also known as the "Fibonacci sphere" or "Fibonacci lattice".

Visually, this is a very reasonable-looking pixelization, with fairly uniform distance between neighbors, and approximate isotropy.  No two pixels will share the same values of either $θ$ or $ϕ$.  Also note that no point is present on either the North or South poles.

The returned quantity is a vector of 2-SVectors providing the spherical coordinates of each pixel.  See also [`golden_ratio_spiral_rotors`](@ref) for the corresponding `Rotor`s.
