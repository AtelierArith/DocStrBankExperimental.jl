Cochain{R, n}
```

Represent the `n`-th group $C^n(K; R)$ of cochains over the ring `R` whose basespace is the simplicial complex $K$.

For constructing Cochains, see also the methods [`zero_cochain`](@ref) and [`indicator_cochain`](@ref).

The elements of this type may be seem as functions from the n-simplices of `K` to `R` or as skew-symmetric n-tensors over the vertices of `K`. This second perspective follows the ideas from the paper:
