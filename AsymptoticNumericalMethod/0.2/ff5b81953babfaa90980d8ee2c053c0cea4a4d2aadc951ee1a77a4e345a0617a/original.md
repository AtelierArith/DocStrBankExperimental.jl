Continuation algorithm based on Asymptotic Numerical Method. It can be used from the package https://github.com/bifurcationkit/AsymptoticNumericalMethod.jl

## Fields

  * `order::Int64`: order of the polynomial approximation
  * `tol::Any`: tolerance which is used to estimate the neighborhood on which the polynomial approximation is valid
