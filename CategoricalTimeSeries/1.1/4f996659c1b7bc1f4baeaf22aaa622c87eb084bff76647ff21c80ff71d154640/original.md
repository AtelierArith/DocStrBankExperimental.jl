Used in the computation of cramer's V and cohen's K. Returns the lagged bivariate probability of two given categories, Pij. Given i and j two categories, and l a lag, Pij is the probability to have the category j at time t + l, if we have i at time t.     inputs :     - time series : the data to analyse     - lag : the value of lag at which one wants Pij     - category1 : the first category     - category2 : the second category     output :     - Pij : the probability to observe j at t + l if we observe i at time t.
