Evaluate Bernstein polynomial

The order of approximation is given implicity by `sum(α)`.

# Arguments

  * `s`: Vertices of simplex
  * `α`: multi-index describing polynomial
  * `x`: location where Bernstein polynomial is evaluated in Cartesian coordinates
  * `λ`: location where Bernstein polynomial is evaluated in barycentric coordinates
