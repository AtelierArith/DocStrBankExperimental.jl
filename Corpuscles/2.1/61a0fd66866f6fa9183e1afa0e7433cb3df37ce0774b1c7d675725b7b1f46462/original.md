isdyon(p::Union{Particle, PDGID, Integer})
```

Magnetic monopoles and Dyons are assumed to have one unit of Dirac monopole charge and a variable integer number xyz units of electric charge, where xyz stands for Nq1 Nq2 Nq3. Codes 411xyz0 are used when the magnetic and electrical charge sign agree and 412xyz0 when they disagree, with the overall sign of the particle set by the magnetic charge. For now, no spin information is provided.
