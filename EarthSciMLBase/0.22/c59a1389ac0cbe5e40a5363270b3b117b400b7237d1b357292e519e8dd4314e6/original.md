Construct periodic boundary conditions for the given `partialdomains`. Periodic boundary conditions are defined as when the value at one side of the domain is set equal to the value at the other side, so that the domain "wraps around" from one side to the other.

  * `partialdomains`: The partial domains, e.g. `[x ∈ Interval(x_min, x_max), y ∈ Interval(y_min, y_max)]`.
