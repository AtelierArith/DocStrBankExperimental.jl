In Bit Flipping Environment we have n bits. The actions are 1 to n where executing i-th action flips the i-th bit of the state. For every episode we sample uniformly and initial state as well as the target state.

Refer [Hindsight Experience Replay paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01495.pdf) for the motivation behind the environment.
