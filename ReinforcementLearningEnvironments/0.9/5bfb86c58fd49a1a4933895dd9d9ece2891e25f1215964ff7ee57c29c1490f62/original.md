In our design, the return of taking an action in `env` is **undefined**. This is the main difference compared to those interfaces defined in [OpenAI/Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym). We find that the async manner is more suitable to describe many complicated environments. However, one of the inconveniences is that we have to cache some intermediate data for future queries. Here we have to store `reward` and `is_terminated` in the instance of `env` for future queries.
