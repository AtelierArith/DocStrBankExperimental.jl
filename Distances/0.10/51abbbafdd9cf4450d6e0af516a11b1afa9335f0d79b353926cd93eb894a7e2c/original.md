Haversine(radius=6_371_000)
```

The haversine distance between two locations on a sphere of given `radius`, whose default value is 6,371,000, i.e., the Earth's (volumetric) mean radius in meters; cf. [NASA's Earth Fact Sheet](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html).

Locations are described with longitude and latitude in degrees. The computed distance has the unit of the radius.
