Abstract type for all [Dynamic Devices](@ref)

A [dynamic](@ref D) [injection](@ref I) is the continuous time response of a generator, typically modeled with differential equations. 

`DynamicInjection` components can added on to [`StaticInjection`](@ref) components, which together define all the information needed to model the device in a dynamic simulation.
