dynamics_bias(state, externalwrenches)

```

Compute the 'dynamics bias term', i.e. the term

$$
c(q, v, w_\text{ext})
$$

in the unconstrained joint-space equations of motion

$$
M(q) \dot{v} + c(q, v, w_\text{ext}) = \tau
$$

given joint configuration vector $q$, joint velocity vector $v$, joint acceleration vector $\dot{v}$ and (optionally) external wrenches $w_\text{ext}$.

The `externalwrenches` argument can be used to specify additional wrenches that act on the `Mechanism`'s bodies.
