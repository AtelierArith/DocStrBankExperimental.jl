Trop{MM<:MinMax, T<:Real}
```

A `Trop` number is an element of a the tropical semi-ring. These come in two flavours `Max` and `Min`. In the `Max` case this is the semi-ring $(ℝ ∪ {-∞}, ⊕, ⊙)$ where $⊕$ is the usual multiplication and $⊙$ is the usual maximum. In the `Min` case this is the semi-ring $(ℝ ∪ {∞}, ⊕, ⊙)$ where $⊕$ is the usual multiplication and $⊙$ is the usual minimum.
