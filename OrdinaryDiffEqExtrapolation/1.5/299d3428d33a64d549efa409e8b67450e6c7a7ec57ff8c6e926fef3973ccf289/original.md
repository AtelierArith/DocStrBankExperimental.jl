Parallelized Explicit Extrapolation Method. Midpoint extrapolation using Barycentric coordinates,     following Hairer's ODEX in the adaptivity behavior.

### Keyword Arguments

  * `max_order`: maximum order of the adaptive order algorithm.
  * `min_order`: minimum order of the adaptive order algorithm.
  * `init_order`: initial order of the adaptive order algorithm.
  * `thread`: determines whether internal broadcasting on appropriate CPU arrays should be serial (`thread = OrdinaryDiffEq.False()`) or use multiple threads (`thread = OrdinaryDiffEq.True()`) when Julia is started with multiple threads.
  * `sequence`: the step-number sequences, also called the subdividing sequence. Possible values are `:harmonic`, `:romberg` or `:bulirsch`.
  * `sequence_factor`: denotes which even multiple of sequence to take while evaluating internal discretizations.
