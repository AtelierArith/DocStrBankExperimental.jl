```
tess_pipeline_word_box(
    pipe::TessPipeline
)::Union{TessOutput{String}, Nothing}
```

Generate a BOX file from the pipeline and save it to a string.  Returns `nothing` if there is a problem adding the BOX generator to the output.

**Arguments:**

| T   | Name | Default | Description                               |
|:--- |:---- |:------- |:----------------------------------------- |
| R   | pipe |         | The pipline to collect the BOX data from. |

**Examples:**

```jldoctest; filter = r"(\s+)"
using Tesseract

# Generate some pages to load.
write("page01.tiff", sample_tiff())
write("page02.tiff", sample_tiff())
write("page03.tiff", sample_tiff())

download_languages() # Make sure we have the data files.

instance = TessInst()
pipeline = TessPipeline(instance)

book = tess_pipeline_word_box(pipeline)

tess_run_pipeline(pipeline, "My First Book") do add
    add(pix_read("page01.tiff"), 72)
    add(pix_read("page02.tiff"), 72)
    add(pix_read("page03.tiff"), 72)
end

for line in split(book[], "\n")[1:10]
    println(line)
end
