write("page01.tiff", sample_tiff())
write("page02.tiff", sample_tiff())
write("page03.tiff", sample_tiff())

download_languages() # Make sure we have the data files.

instance = TessInst()
pipeline = TessPipeline(instance)

tess_pipeline_text(pipeline, "My Book.txt")

tess_run_pipeline(pipeline, "My First Book") do add
    add(pix_read("page01.tiff"), 72)
    add(pix_read("page02.tiff"), 72)
    add(pix_read("page03.tiff"), 72)
end

for line in readlines("My Book.txt")[1:10]
