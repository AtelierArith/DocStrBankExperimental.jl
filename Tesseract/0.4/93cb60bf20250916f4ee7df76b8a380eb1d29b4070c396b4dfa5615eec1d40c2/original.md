```
tess_pipeline_text(
    pipe::TessPipeline
)::Union{TessOutput{String}, Nothing}
```

Generate a text file from the pipeline and save it to a string.  Returns `nothing` if there is a problem adding the text generator to the output.

**Arguments:**

| T   | Name | Default | Description                           |
|:--- |:---- |:------- |:------------------------------------- |
| R   | pipe |         | The pipline to collect the text from. |

**Examples:**

```jldoctest
using Tesseract

# Generate some pages to load.
write("page01.tiff", sample_tiff())
write("page02.tiff", sample_tiff())
write("page03.tiff", sample_tiff())

download_languages() # Make sure we have the data files.

instance = TessInst()
pipeline = TessPipeline(instance)

book = tess_pipeline_text(pipeline)

tess_run_pipeline(pipeline, "My First Book") do add
    add(pix_read("page01.tiff"), 72)
    add(pix_read("page02.tiff"), 72)
    add(pix_read("page03.tiff"), 72)
end

count = 0
for line in split(book[], "\n")[1:10]
    global count
    if count < 10
        println(line)
    end
    count += 1
end
