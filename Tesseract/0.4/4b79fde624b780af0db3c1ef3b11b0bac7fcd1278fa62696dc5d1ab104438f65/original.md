```
tess_unlv_latin1(
    inst::TessInst
)::Union{String, Nothing}
```

Extract the text in UNLV format Latin-1 with reject and suspect codes.  If there is an error `nothing` is returned.

**Arguments:**

| T   | Name | Default | Description                     |
|:--- |:---- |:------- |:------------------------------- |
| R   | inst |         | The Tesseract instance to call. |

**Details:**

This method will call `tess_recognize()` if it has not been called yet for the image.

This method is more used to test the OCR results than anything else.  This method returns the OCR data in Latin1 encoding.  If you want to use it as a string in Julia use the [`tess_unlv`](@ref) method which will convert it to UTF-8 for you.

**Example:**

```jldoctest
using Tesseract

download_languages()

instance = TessInst()
pix = sample_pix()

tess_image(instance, pix)
tess_resolution(instance, 72)

unlv = tess_unlv_latin1(instance)
