```
tess_pipeline_text(
    func::Function,
    pipe::TessPipeline
)::Union{TessOutput, Nothing}
```

Generate a text file from the pipeline and pass it back to the client via a callback. Returns `false` if there is a problem adding the text generator to the output.

**Arguments:**

| T   | Name | Default | Description                                  |
|:--- |:---- |:------- |:-------------------------------------------- |
| R   | func |         | The function to call with the lines of text. |
| R   | pipe |         | The pipline to collect the text from.        |

**Details:**

The text will be passed to the caller one line at a time. The "\n" line terminator will be included with the text.

Tesseract inserts a "page separator" between pages, by default this value is "\f", however it can be changed with [`tess_set_param`](@ref).  If you want to use different text to separate the pages you must set the value before calling this function.

**Examples:**

```jldoctest
using Tesseract

# Generate some pages to load.
write("page01.tiff", sample_tiff())
write("page02.tiff", sample_tiff())
write("page03.tiff", sample_tiff())

download_languages() # Make sure we have the data files.

instance = TessInst()
pipeline = TessPipeline(instance)

count = 0
tess_pipeline_text(pipeline) do line
    global count
    if count < 10
        print(line)
    end
    count += 1
end

tess_run_pipeline(pipeline, "My First Book") do add
    add(pix_read("page01.tiff"), 72)
    add(pix_read("page02.tiff"), 72)
    add(pix_read("page03.tiff"), 72)
end
