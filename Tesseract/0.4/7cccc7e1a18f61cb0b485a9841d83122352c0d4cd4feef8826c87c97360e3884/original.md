tess_pipeline_word_box(
    func::Function,
    pipe::TessPipeline
)::Bool
```

Generate a BOX file from the pipeline and pass it back to the client via a callback. Returns `false` if there is a problem adding the BOX generator to the output.

**Arguments:**

| T   | Name | Default | Description                                  |
|:--- |:---- |:------- |:-------------------------------------------- |
| R   | func |         | The function to call with the lines of text. |
| R   | pipe |         | The pipline to collect the BOX data from.    |

**Details:**

The text will be passed to the caller one line at a time. The "\n" line terminator will be included with the text.

**Examples:**

```jldoctest; filter = r"(\s+)"
using Tesseract

# Generate some pages to load.
write("page01.tiff", sample_tiff())
write("page02.tiff", sample_tiff())
write("page03.tiff", sample_tiff())

download_languages() # Make sure we have the data files.

pipeline = TessPipeline(instance)

tess_pipeline_word_box(pipeline) do line
    global count
    if count < 10
        print(line)
    end
    count += 1
end

    add(pix_read("page01.tiff"), 72)
    add(pix_read("page02.tiff"), 72)
    add(pix_read("page03.tiff"), 72)
