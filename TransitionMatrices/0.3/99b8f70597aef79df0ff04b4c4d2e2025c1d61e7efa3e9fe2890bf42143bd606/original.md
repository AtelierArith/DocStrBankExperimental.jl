Prism{N, T, CT}(a, h, m)
```

A prism scatterer. The number of base edges is represented by the type parameter `N`. The prism is assumed to be aligned with the z-axis, and one of The lateral edges is assumed to have `Ï†=0`.

Attributes:

  * `a`: the length of the prism base.
  * `h`: the height of the prism.
  * `m`: the relative complex refractive index.
