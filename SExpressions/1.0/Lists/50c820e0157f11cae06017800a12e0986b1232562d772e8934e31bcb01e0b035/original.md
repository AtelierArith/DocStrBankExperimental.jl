An object which is essentially a pair of two objects.

The two objects are referred to, for historical reasons, as `car` and `cdr`.These abbreviations are not semantically relevant today, so can generally be thought of as the head object and the tail object. For `Cons` objects which are (proper) lists, the `car` (head) object will be the first element of the list, and the `cdr` (tail) object will be a list representing the remaining elements.
