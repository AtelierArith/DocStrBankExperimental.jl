An object representing nothing, or an empty list.

The singleton instance of this type is called `nil`. This type is isomorphic to, and very similar, to `Nothing`. However, it is often useful to distinguish the `nil` used within many lisp dialects from a true `Nothing`, because `nil` is iterable and represents an empty list.
