```
lcurve(lowest_value, highest_value, number_of_steps)
```

Constructor for testing all L-curve curvatures between some bounds and  picking the optimal.

  * `lowest_value` is the lowest alpha value.
  * `highest_value` is the highest alpha value.
  * `number_of_steps` is the number of alpha values that will be tested.

This is a very crude and rather slow method, mostly for demonstration purposes.
