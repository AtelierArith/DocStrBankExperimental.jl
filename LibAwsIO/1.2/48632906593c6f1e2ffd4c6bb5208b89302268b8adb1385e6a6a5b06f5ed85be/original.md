Invoked once an address has been resolved for host. The type in host_addresses is struct [`aws_host_address`](@ref) (by-value). The caller does not own this memory and you must copy the host address before returning from this function if you plan to use it later. For convenience, we've provided the [`aws_host_address_copy`](@ref)() and [`aws_host_address_clean_up`](@ref)() functions.
