Callback for when the pipe is readable (edge-triggered), or an error has occurred. Afer subscribing, the callback is invoked when the pipe has data to read, or the pipe has an error. The readable callback is invoked again any time the user reads all data, and then more data arrives. Note that it will not be invoked again if the pipe still has unread data when more data arrives. `error_code` of AWS_ERROR_SUCCESS indicates a readable event, and otherwise contains the value of the error. `user_data` corresponds to the `user_data` passed into aws_pipe_subscribe_to_read_events(). This callback is always invoked on the read-end's event-loop thread.
