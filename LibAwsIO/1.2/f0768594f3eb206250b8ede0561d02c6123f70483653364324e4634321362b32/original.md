Callback for when the asynchronous [`aws_pipe_write`](@ref)() operation has either completed or failed. `write_end` will be NULL if this callback is invoked after the the write-end has been cleaned up, this does not necessarily mean that the write operation failed. `error_code` will be AWS_ERROR_SUCCESS if all data was written, or a code corresponding to the error. `src_buffer` corresponds to the buffer passed into [`aws_pipe_write`](@ref)() `user_data` corresponds to the `user_data` passed into [`aws_pipe_write`](@ref)(). This callback is always invoked on the write-end's event-loop thread.
