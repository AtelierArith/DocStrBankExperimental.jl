Convert a Julia file to a `.cast` file that can be played by asciinema. The return value is a string as the content of the `.cast` file.

### Keyword Arguments

The following keyword arguments are for global configurations,

  * `mod` is the module to execute the input Julia script.
  * `output_file` is the `.cast` file as output, the default value `nothing` for not generating a file.
  * `start_delay` is time delay before running the first statement.
  * `width` and `height` are the width and height of the terminal.
  * `randomness` is the uncertainty in the time delay.
  * if `show_julia_version` is true, show Julia welcome page.
  * if `show_pkg_status`is true, show package status at the begining.
  * if `tada` is true, show `ðŸŽ‰` at the end of the show.

The following keyword arguments are for the initial statement-wise configurations,

  * `prompt_delay` is the time delay between `julia>` and the statement input.
  * `char_delay` is the time delay between typing two chars.
  * `output_delay` is time delay between the input and the output of a statement.
  * `output_row_delay` is time delay between rows of the output of a statement.
  * `delay` is time delay after running a statement.

### Examples

```jldoctest; setup=:(using AsciinemaGenerator)
julia> using AsciinemaGenerator

julia> output_file = tempname()
"/tmp/jl_g7aZCDUbC7"

julia> cast_file(joinpath("test/test_input.jl"); output_file, mod=Main);

shell> asciinema play /tmp/jl_g7aZCDUbC7
```

The last line plays the clip, please refer the `Play` section of this docstring.

### Input file

The statement-wise arguments can also be specify in the input Julia source file. e.g.

```julia
shell> cat test/test_input.jl
@show "Hello"

using Pkg

#: Waiting for 5 seconds
#+ 5
#s delay=1.0; output_row_delay=0.3

println("haa"); Pkg.status()
```

Lines starting with `#s` are for setting parameters, different assign statements should be separated by `;`. Lines starting with `#+` are for inserting an extra time delay. Other lines starting with `#` are regular comments, which will also be shown in the `.cast` file!

### Play

To install `asciinema`, please check the [official site](https://asciinema.org/docs/installation). One can also deploy the `.cast` file in a website, please check the `demo` folder in the `demo` branch of this repo for a minimum [Franklin](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl) static site example.
