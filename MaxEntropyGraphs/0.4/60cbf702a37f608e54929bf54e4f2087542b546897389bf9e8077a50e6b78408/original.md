```

A small weighted, directed network that contains observed grooming episodes between free ranging rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) in Cayo Santiago during a two month period in 1963. Cayo Santiago is an island off the coast of Puerto Rico, also known as Isla de los monos (Island of the monkeys). A node represents a monkey and a directed edge A â†’ B denotes that the rhesus macaque A groomed rhesus macaque B. The integer edge weights indicate how often this behaviour was observed.
