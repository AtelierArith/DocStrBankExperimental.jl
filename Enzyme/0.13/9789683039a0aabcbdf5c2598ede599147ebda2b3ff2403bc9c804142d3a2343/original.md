```
hvp(f::F, x::X, v::X) where {F, X}
```

Compute the Hessian-vector product of an array-input scalar-output function `f`, as evaluated at `x` times the vector `v`.

In other words, compute hessian(f)(x) * v

See [`hvp!`](@ref) for a version which stores the result in an existing buffer and also [`hvp_and_gradient!`](@ref) for a function to compute both the hvp and the gradient in a single call.

Example:

```jldoctest hvp; filter = r"([0-9]+\.[0-9]{8})[0-9]+" => s"\1***"
f(x) = sin(x[1] * x[2])

hvp(f, [2.0, 3.0], [5.0, 2.7])

# output
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 19.6926882637302
 16.201003759768003
```
