WSVarScoreTestInvariant
```

A base object for the score test of within-subject variance linear mixed model data instance, independent of the input data. Numbers of test variables should be predetermined.

H0: β1 = 0 and τ1 = 0, H1: β1 ≠ 0 or τ1 ≠ 0, for the full model of WiSER (with parameters β = [β1, β2], τ = [τ1, τ2], and Lγ). We make use of the fitted null model.
