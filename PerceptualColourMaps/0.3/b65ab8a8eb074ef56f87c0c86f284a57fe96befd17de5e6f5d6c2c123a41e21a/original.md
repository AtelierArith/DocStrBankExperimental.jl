applycolormap: Applies colourmap to a single channel image to obtain an RGB result

```
Usage: rgbimg = applycolormap(img, cmap, rnge)

Arguments:  img - Single channel image to apply colourmap to.
                  ::ImageMeta{T,2} or ::Array{Float64,2}
           cmap - RGB colourmap as generated by cmap().
                  ::Array{ColorTypes.RGBA{Float64},1}
           rnge - Optional 2-vector specifying the min and max values in
                  the image to be mapped across the colour map.  Values
                  outside this range are mapped to the end points of the
                  colour map.  If range is omitted the full range
                  of image values are used.

Returns: rgbimg - RGB image of floating point values in the range 0-1.
                  NaN values in the input image are rendered as black.
                  ::ImageMeta{Float64,3} or ::Array{Float64,3}
