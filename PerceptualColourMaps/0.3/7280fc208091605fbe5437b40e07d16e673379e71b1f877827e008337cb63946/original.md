applydivergingcolourmap/applydivergingcolormap - Applies a diverging colour map to an image

For data to be displayed correctly with a diverging colour map it is important that the data values are respected so that the reference value in the data is correctly associated with the centre entry of a diverging colour map.

In contrast, default display methods typically do not respect data values directly and can perform inappropriate offsetting and normalisation of the data before display and rendering with a colour map.

```
Usage:  rgbim = applydivergingcolourmap(img, map, refval)

Arguments:
           img - Image to be rendered.  ::ImageMeta or ::Array{Float64,2}
           map - Colour map to render the data with.
        refval - Reference value to be associated with centre point of
                 diverging colour map.  Defaults to 0.
Returns:
        rgbimg - The rendered image.
                 ::ImageMeta{Float64,3} or ::Array{Float64,3}
```
