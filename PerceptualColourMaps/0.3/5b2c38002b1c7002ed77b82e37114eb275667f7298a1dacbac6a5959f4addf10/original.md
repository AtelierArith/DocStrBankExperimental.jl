applycycliccolourmap/applycycliccolormap: Applies a cyclic colour map to an image of angular data

For angular data to be rendered correctly it is important that the data values are respected so that data values are correctly assigned to specific entries in a cyclic colour map.  The assignment of values to colours also depends on whether the data is cyclic over pi, or 2*pi.

In contrast, default display methods typically do not respect data values directly and can perform inappropriate offsetting and normalisation of the angular data before display and rendering with a colour map.

The rendering of the angular data with a specified colour map can be modulated as a function of an associated image amplitude.  This allows the colour map encoding of the angular information to be modulated to represent the amplitude/reliability/coherence of the angular data.

```
Usage: rgbimg = applycycliccolourmap(ang, cmap)
       rgbimg = applycycliccolourmap(ang, cmap, keyword args ...)

Arguments:
           ang - Image of angular data to be rendered
                 ::ImageMeta or ::Array{Float64,2}
          cmap - Cyclic colour map to render the angular data with.

Keyword arguments:

           amp - Amplitude image used to modulate the mapped colours of the
                 angular data.  If not supplied no modulation of colours is
                 performed.
                 ::ImageMeta or ::Array{Float64,2}
   modtoblack  - Boolean flag/1 indicating whether the amplitude image is used to
                 modulate the colour mapped image values towards black,
                 or towards white.  The default is true, towards black.
   cyclelength - The cycle length of the angular data.  Use a value of pi
                 if the data represents orientations, or 2*pi if the data
                 represents phase values.  If the input data is in degrees
                 simply set cycle in degrees and the data will be
                 rendered appropriately. Default is 2*pi.

Returns: rgbim - The rendered image.
                 ::ImageMeta{Float64,3} or ::Array{Float64,3}
