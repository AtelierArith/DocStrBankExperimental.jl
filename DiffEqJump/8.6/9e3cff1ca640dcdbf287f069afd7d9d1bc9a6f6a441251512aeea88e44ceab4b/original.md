Gillespie's Direct method. `ConstantRateJump` rates and affects are stored via `FunctionWrappers`, which is more performant than `Direct` for very large numbers of `ConstantRateJump`s. However, for such large numbers of jump different classes of aggregators are usually much more performant (i.e. `SortingDirect`, `DirectCR`, `RSSA` or `RSSACR`).
