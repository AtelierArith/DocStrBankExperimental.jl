# Variables

(!!NOTICE!!) The variables in this code probably follow the notation of the original paper as follows: `x` and `y` denote non-convex and convex inputs, respectively. `g̃` and `g` denote activation functions of `x`- and `y`- paths, respectively. Furthermore, `u` and `z` denote `x`- and `y`-path variables, respectively.
