AbstractPhaseSpaceLayout
```

The `AbstractPhaseSpaceLayout` is an abstract type that represents the general concept of a phase space layout in a scattering process.

## Interface Functions to Implement:

  * `phase_space_dimension(proc, model, layout::AbstractPhaseSpaceLayout)`: Defines the number   of independent phase space coordinates needed to build the momenta.
