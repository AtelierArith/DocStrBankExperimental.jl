Parameter type that holds information on a population's birth and death rates, `birth` and `death`, specifically populations where all species have the same information. `l` represents the longevity of species based on their energy requirements and `s` is the survival of species dependent on how well their traits reflect the environment. Finally `boost` is used to manipulate how much of a boost the species get from being in an environment with lots of available energy.
