Spin-$S$ XXZ model represented as the following Hamiltonian,

$\mathcal{H} = \sum_{i,j} \left[ J_{ij}^z S_i^z S_j^z              + \frac{J_{ij}^{xy}}{2} (S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^-S_j^+) \right]             - \sum_i \Gamma_i S_i^x,$

where $S^x, S^y, S^z$ are $x, y$ and $z$ component of spin operator with length $S$, and $S^\pm \equiv S^x \pm iS^y$ are ladder operator. A state is represented by a product state (spins at $\tau=0$) of local $S^z$ diagonal basis and an operator string (perturbations). A local spin with length $S$ is represented by a symmetrical summation of $2S$ sub spins with length $1/2$.
