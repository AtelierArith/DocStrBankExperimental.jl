LUT must be a vector with the length of the number of antenna elements of type SVector of Matrices. Each matrix must have the size of #elevation angles x #azimuth angles. The azimuth angle starts from the x-Axis and increases towards the y-Axis. The zenith must be at the top of the matrix and the horizont / bottom must be at the bottom of the matrix. The maximal elevation is given by `max_elevation`. A value of `π/2` means horizont and `π` until bottom of antenna. The type of interpolation can be set by the optional parameter `interpolation`. Possible values are: `Constant`, `Linear` or `Quadratic`. For more information see regarding the interpolation, see: https://github.com/JuliaMath/Interpolations.jl.
