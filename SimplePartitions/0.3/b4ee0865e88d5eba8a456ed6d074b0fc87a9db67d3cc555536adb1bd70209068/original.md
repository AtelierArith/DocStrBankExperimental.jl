`all_partitions(A::Set)` creates a `Set` containing all possible partitions of the set `A`.

`all_partitions(n::Int)` creates the `Set` of all partitions of the set `{1,2,...,n}`.

Both of these take an optional second argument `k` to specify that only partitions with exactly `k` parts should be returned.
