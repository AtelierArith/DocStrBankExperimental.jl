Performs an Engel expansion of the given rational number into a sum of fractions of the form `1/a + 1/(a*b) + 1/(a*b*c)...`.

This function returns only the unique denominators of the expansion (i.e., only `[a, b, ...]`).  If the given rational number `r` satisfies `r â‰¥ 1`, the first `n` elements of the expansion will be 1, where `n = floor(r)`.
