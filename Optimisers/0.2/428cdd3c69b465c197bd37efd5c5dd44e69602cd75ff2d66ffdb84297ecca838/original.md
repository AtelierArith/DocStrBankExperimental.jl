```
Momentum(η = 1f-2, ρ = 9f-1)
```

Gradient descent optimizer with learning rate `η` and momentum `ρ`.

# Parameters

  * Learning rate (`η`): Amount by which gradients are discounted before updating                      the weights.
  * Momentum (`ρ`): Controls the acceleration of gradient descent in the                 prominent direction, in effect dampening oscillations.
