```
Nesterov(η = 1f-3, ρ = 9f-1)
```

Gradient descent optimizer with learning rate `η` and Nesterov momentum `ρ`.

# Parameters

  * Learning rate (`η`): Amount by which gradients are discounted before updating                      the weights.
  * Nesterov momentum (`ρ`): Controls the acceleration of gradient descent in the                          prominent direction, in effect dampening oscillations.
