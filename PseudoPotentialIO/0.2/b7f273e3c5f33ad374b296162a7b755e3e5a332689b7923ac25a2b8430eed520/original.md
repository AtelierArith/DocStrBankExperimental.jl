abstract type NumericPsP{T} <: PseudoPotentialIO.AbstractPsP
```

Abstract type representing numeric pseudopotentials.

All quantities must be in Hartree atomic units.

  * Lengths in Bohr radii (a₀)
  * Energies in Hartree (Ha / Eₕ)
  * Electric charge in electron charges (e = 1)
  * Mass in electron masses (mₑ)
  * Action in reduced Plank constants (ħ = 1)

Vectors indexed by angular momentum should be `OffsetVector`s with indices starting at zero so that angular momentum `l`, which naturally starts at 0, can be used for both computation and indexing.

Required fields:

```julia
# Checksum
checksum::Vector{UInt8}
# Atomic total charge in units of electron charge
Zatom::Number
# Pseudo-atomic valence charge in units of electron charge
Zval::Number
# Maximum angular momentum
lmax::Integer
# Radial mesh in units of Bohr
r::AbstractVector{Real}
# Radial mesh spacing in units of Bohr
dr::Union{Real, AbstractVector{Real}}
# Local potential on the radial mesh in units of Hartree (without r² prefactor)
Vloc::AbstractVector{Real}
## The units of `D` and `β` should be such that `⟨ βˡₙ | Dˡₙₙ | βˡₙ ⟩` gives Hartree
# Nonlocal projector coupling constants D[l][n,n']
D::OffsetVector{AbstractMatrix{Real}}
# Nonlocal projectors on the radial mesh, multiplied by the mesh squared: r²β[l][n]
β::OffsetVector{AbstractVector{AbstractVector{Real}}}

## "Optional" fields (must still exist, but could be Union{Nothing})
# Model core charge density (non-linear core correction) on the radial mesh, multiplied by
# the mesh squared: r²ρcore
ρcore::Union{Nothing,AbstractVector{Real}}
# Pseudo-atomic valence charge density on the radial mesh, multiplied by the mesh squared:
# r²ρval
ρval::Union{Nothing,AbstractVector{Real}}
# Pseudo-atomic orbitals on the radial mesh, multiplied by the mesh squared: r²χ[l][n]
χ::Union{Nothing,OffsetVector{AbstractVector{AbstractVector{Real}}}}
```
