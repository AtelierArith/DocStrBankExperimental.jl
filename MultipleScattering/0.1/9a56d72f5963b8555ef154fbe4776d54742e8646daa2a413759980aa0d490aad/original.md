A shape which contains all particles,$x > x_0$, necessary to simulate a plane-wave scattering from an infinite medium, for a reciever at the focal point, for time $t < D / c$, where $c$ is the sound speed of the background medium, and $D$ is some chosen focal distance. The plane-wave travels towards the positive direction of the $x$ axis.

More precisely, if the focal point is at $(x_f,y_f)$ then the interior of the shape is defined as $(y - y_f)^2 < (D + x_0)^2 - x_f^2 - 2(D + x_0 - x_f)x$  and $x > min(x_0, x_f)$ where $D$ is the focal distance.
