A shape where anything inside could cause a disturbance at the listener position from a point source wavefront starting at the listener. Also everything inside has a positive `x` coordinate. It is equivalent to a segment of a circle.

More precisely, if the listener is at (l*x,l*y) then the interior of the shape is defined as sqrt((x-l*x)^2+(y-l*y)^2)<time and x>0
