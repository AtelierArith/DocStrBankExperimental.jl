```
ElasticManager <: Distributed.ClusterManager
```

A cluster manager that allows for adding and removing workers dynamically.

Constructor:

```julia
function ElasticManager(;
    addr=IPv4("127.0.0.1"), port=9009, cookie=nothing,
    topology=:all_to_all, manage_callback=elastic_no_op_callback
)
```

The manager will listen for worker connections on `addr:port`. Workers have to authenticate themselves with `cookie` (randomly generated by default). `topology` sets the Julia cluster topology and may be `:all_to_all` or `:master_worker` (see documentation of `Distributed.addprocs` for details.

Workers are not added via `Distributed.addprocs`, instead started via [`ElasticClusterManager.elastic_worker`](@ref) from external Julia processes, this is up to the user.

If `manage_callback` is set to a user-provided `my_manage_callback`, it will be called on the primary Julia process when `Distributed.manage` adds or removes an elastic worker. The callback signature is

```julia
my_manage_callback(mgr::ElasticManager, id::Integer, :register)
my_manage_callback(mgr::ElasticManager, id::Integer, :deregister)
```

This can be used to automatically add workers to a `Distributed.WorkerPool`, and so on.
