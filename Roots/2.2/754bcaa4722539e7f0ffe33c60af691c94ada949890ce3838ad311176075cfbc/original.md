Order0()
```

The `Order0` method is engineered to be a more robust, though possibly slower, alternative to the other derivative-free root-finding methods. The implementation roughly follows the algorithm described in *Personal Calculator Has Key to Solve Any Equation $f(x) = 0$*, the SOLVE button from the [HP-34C](http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1979-12.pdf). The basic idea is to use a secant step. If along the way a bracket is found, switch to a bracketing algorithm, using `AlefeldPotraShi`.  If the secant step fails to decrease the function value, a quadratic step is used up to $4$ times.

This is not really $0$-order: the secant method has order $1.6...$ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_method#Comparison_with_other_root-finding_methods) and the the bracketing method has order $1.6180...$ [Wikipedia](http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1993-61-204/S0025-5718-1993-1192965-2/S0025-5718-1993-1192965-2.pdf) so for reasonable starting points and functions, this algorithm should be superlinear, and relatively robust to non-reasonable starting points.
