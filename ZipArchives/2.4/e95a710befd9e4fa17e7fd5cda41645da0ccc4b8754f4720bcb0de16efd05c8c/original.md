```
zip_writefile(w::ZipWriter, name::AbstractString, data::AbstractVector{UInt8})
```

Write data as a file entry named `name`.

Unlike `zip_newfile`, the underlying IO only needs to implement  `Base.unsafe_write` and `Base.isopen`. `w` isn't writable after. The written data will not be compressed.
