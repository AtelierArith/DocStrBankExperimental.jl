The `vectorfield` function returns a datastructure that stores the vectorfield for an `AbstractStateVariable` `s` that holds the state of a system. By default it returns a `VectorfieldVariable` that wraps `zero(parent(s))`, i.e., the same kind of array as the state variable, but custom methods can be implemented in order to account for more specific use cases, e.g., when `s` also contains constant fields that should not be present in the vector field.
