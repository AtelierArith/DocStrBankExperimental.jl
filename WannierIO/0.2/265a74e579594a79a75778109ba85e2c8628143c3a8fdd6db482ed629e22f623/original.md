```julia
read_w90_band_dat(filename)

```

Read `prefix_band.dat` file generated by `wannier90.x`, or `prefix-band.dat` file generated by `postw90.x`.

# Return

  * `x`: `n_kpts`, x axis value of kpath, in cartesian length
  * `eigenvalues`: length-`n_kpts` vector, each elemnt is a length-`n_bands` vector   of band energies
  * `extras`: optional (the `postw90.x` might generate a file with a third column),   same size as `eigenvalues`, often the color of each eigenvalue,   e.g., spin projection
