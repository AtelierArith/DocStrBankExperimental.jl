startETCCDI()

The start method `startETCCDI` resp. `startStdMeteo` is a simple threshold based procedure as defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (cf. ETCCDI 2009, Frich et al. 2002, Zhang et al. 2011) leading to quite early vegetation starts. This method is widely used in climate change studies.
