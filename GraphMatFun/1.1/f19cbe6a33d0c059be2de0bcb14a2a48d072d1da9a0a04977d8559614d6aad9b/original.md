```
 (graph,crefs)=graph_exp_native_jl(A; input=:A)
```

Creates a graph for the native scaling-and-squaring for the matrix exponential, as implemented in Julia. The matrix `A` is taken as input to determine the length of the Pad√© approximant and the number of squares applied, as well as determining the type of the coefficients. The kwarg `input` determines the name of the matrix, in the graph.
