degopt=Degopt(x,y)
degopt=Degopt(HA,HB,y)
degopt=Degopt(graph)

struct Degopt{T}
    x::Vector{Tuple{Vector{T},Vector{T}}}
    y::Vector{T}
end
```

Creates an object representing a degree-optimal polynomial, i.e., the coefficients in an evaluation scheme which maximizes the degree for a fixed number of multiplications. The object represents the coefficients in

```
A0=I
A1=A
A2=(x *A0+x *A1)(x *A0+x *A1)
A4=(x *A0+x *A1+x*A2)(x *A0+x *A1+x *A2)
A8=(x *A0+x *A1+x*A2)(x *A0+x *A1+x *A2)
 ..
```

and

```
Out=y*A0+y*A1+y*A4+y*A8+y*B4...
```

The `x`-values are given in the argument `x`, which is a `Vector{Tuple{Vector{T},Vector{T}}}`, containing the elements of each sum. The `y`-vector contains the elements to form the output. In the constructor with `HA`, `HB` and `y` the elements of `x` are stored as matrices.

The coefficients in graphs generated by [`graph_degopt`](@ref) can be recovered by using `Degopt(graph)`.
