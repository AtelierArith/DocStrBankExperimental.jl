```
setshadow(offsetx::Real, offsety::Real, blur::Real)
```

`setshadow` allows drawing of shadows, realized by images painted underneath, and offset from, graphics objects such that the shadow mimics the effect of a light source cast on the graphics objects.

**Parameters:**

`offsetx` :     An x-offset, which specifies how far in the horizontal direction the     shadow is offset from the object `offsety` :     A y-offset, which specifies how far in the vertical direction the shadow     is offset from the object `blur` :     A blur value, which specifies whether the object has a hard or a diffuse     edge
