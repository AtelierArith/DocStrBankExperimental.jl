M = duplicationop(n)
M = duplicationop(A)

Define the duplication operator of all `n√ón` matrices to reconstruct a hermitian matrix from its upper triangular elements  or of all square matrices of size of `A`. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplication_and_elimination_matrices) for the  definition of a duplication matrix from the lower triangular parts.
