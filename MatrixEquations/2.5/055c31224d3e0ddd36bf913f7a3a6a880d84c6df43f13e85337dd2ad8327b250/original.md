```
M = eliminationop(n)
M = eliminationop(A)
```

Define the elimination operator of all `n√ón` matrices to select their upper triangular parts or of all square matrices of size of `A`.   See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplication_and_elimination_matrices) for the  definition of an elimination matrix for the selection of lower triangular parts.
