```
scatteredfield(sphere::DielectricSphere, excitation::UniformField, point, quantity::ScalarPotential; parameter::Parameter=Parameter())
```

Compute the scalar potential scattered by a dielectric sphere, for an incident uniform field with polarization in given direction.

The point and the returned field are in Cartesian coordinates.
