```
scatteredfield(sphere::DielectricSphere, excitation::UniformField, point, quantity::ElectricField; parameter::Parameter=Parameter())
```

Compute the electric field scattered by a Dielectric sphere, for an incident uniform field with polarization in given direction.

The point and the returned field are in Cartesian coordinates.
