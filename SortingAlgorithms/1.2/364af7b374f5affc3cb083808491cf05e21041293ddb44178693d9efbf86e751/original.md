CombSort
```

Indicates that a sorting function should use the comb sort algorithm. Comb sort traverses the collection multiple times ordering pairs of elements with a given interval between them. The interval decreases exponentially until it becomes 1, then it switches to insertion sort on the whole input.

Characteristics:

  * *not stable* does not preserve the ordering of elements which compare equal (e.g. "a" and "A" in a sort of letters which ignores case).
  * *in-place* in memory.
  * *parallelizable* suitable for vectorization with SIMD instructions because it performs many independent comparisons.
  * *pathological inputs* such as `repeat(1:5.0, 4^8)` can make this algorithm perform very poorly.
  * *`n log n` average runtime* measured for random inputs of length up to 100 million, but theoretical runtime of `Î˜(n^2)` for extremely long inputs.
