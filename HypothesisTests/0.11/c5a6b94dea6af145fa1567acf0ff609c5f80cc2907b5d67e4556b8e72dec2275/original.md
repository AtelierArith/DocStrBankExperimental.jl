DurbinWatsonTest(X::AbstractArray, e::AbstractVector; p_compute::Symbol = :ndep)
```

Compute the Durbin-Watson test for serial correlation in the residuals of a regression model.

`X` is the matrix of regressors from the original regression model and `e` the vector of residuals. Note that the Durbin-Watson test is not valid if `X` includes a lagged dependent variable. The test statistic is computed as

$$
DW = \frac{\sum_{t=2}^n (e_t - e_{t-1})^2}{\sum_{t=1}^n e_t^2}
$$

where `n` is the number of observations.

By default, the choice of approach to compute p-values depends on the sample size (`p_compute=:ndep`). For small samples (n<100), Pan's algorithm (Farebrother, 1980) is employed. For larger samples, a normal approximation is used (Durbin and Watson, 1950). To always use Pan's algorithm, set `p_compute=:exact`. `p_compute=:approx` will always use the normal approximation.

Default is a two-sided p-value for the alternative hypothesis of positive or negative serial correlation. One-sided p-values can be requested by calling `pvalue(x::DurbinWatsonTest; tail=)` with the options `:left` (negative serial correlation) and `:right` (positive serial correlation).
