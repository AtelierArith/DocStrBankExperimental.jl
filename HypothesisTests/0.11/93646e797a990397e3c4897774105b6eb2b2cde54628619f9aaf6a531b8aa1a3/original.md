Perform Fligner-Killeen median test of the null hypothesis that the `groups` have equal variances, a test for homogeneity of variances.

This test is most robust against departures from normality, see references. It is a $k$-sample simple linear rank method that uses the ranks of the absolute values of the centered samples and weights

$$
a_{N,i} = \Phi^{-1}(1/2 + (i/2(N+1)))
$$

The version implemented here uses median centering in each of the samples.
