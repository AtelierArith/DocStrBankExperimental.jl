```
confint(test::PowerDivergenceTest; level = 0.95, tail = :both, method = :auto)
```

Compute a confidence interval with coverage `level` for multinomial proportions using one of the following methods. Possible values for `method` are:

  * `:auto` (default): If the minimum of the expected cell counts exceeds 100, Quesenberry-Hurst intervals are used, otherwise Sison-Glaz.
  * `:sison_glaz`: Sison-Glaz intervals
  * `:bootstrap`: Bootstrap intervals
  * `:quesenberry_hurst`: Quesenberry-Hurst intervals
  * `:gold`: Gold intervals (asymptotic simultaneous intervals)
